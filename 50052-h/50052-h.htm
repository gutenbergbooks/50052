<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> a former book I endeavoured, from information
gathered out of the records of the first half of
the fourteenth century, to give some idea of the
court and social conditions of France at that time,
and also of the first three Valois Queens, whose very
existence appears unknown to the average English
reader. This was no easy matter owing to the
scarcity of details, which had to be carefully gleaned
from amongst masses of histories and chronicles of
battles, sieges, conspiracies, general councils, and
other public events.</p>

<p>The present volume treats of the years between
the latter part of the fourteenth and beginning of the
sixteenth centuries, about which so much more information
exists that I have found it necessary to
abandon, for want of space, my intention of giving
a short account of the courts of Marie d’Anjou and
Charlotte de Savoie, wives of Charles VII. and Louis
XI., who took very little part in public affairs; and
to give a much shorter account of the reign of Anne
de Bretagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
Very little has been written about Isabeau de
Bavière, and much less still concerning Jeanne de
Bourbon, whereas a great deal is known of Anne
de Bretagne, the history of whose life has more than
once been related. To an interesting biography of
her by Louisa Stuart Costello, and an invaluable
one by Le Roux de Lincy I am much indebted. I
have, as before, consulted many early chronicles,
histories, and letters, French, English, German,
Italian, and Spanish, besides the works of various
excellent modern writers, whose names I quote.
Accuracy being of the greatest importance in books
like these, I give, in reply to the observation of
a critic, that the lines I quoted referring to the
siege of Cassel are incorrect, the original of <span class="locked">De
Nangis:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In dicto vero castro, in regis et totius Francorum
exercitus derisum et subsannationem, in quodam
eminenti loco posuerant Flammingi quemdam gallum
permaximum de tela tincta, dicentes: ‘Quando gallus
iste cantabit, rex Cassellum capiet vi armorum.’ Unde
et gallice in gallo scriptum erat:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘Quand ce coq chanté aura,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le Roy Cassel conquestera.’”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div></blockquote>

<p class="in0">I quoted these lines from the “Grandes Chroniques.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
To another critic who says he has never heard of
the “Grand dictionnaire de Morèry,” and suggests
that no such book exists, I can only reply that I have
it upon my shelves. It is in several folio volumes,
was published at Paris 1699, and is quoted by various
historians. It is sometimes spelt “Morèri.”</p>

<p>Jeanne de Bourbon was the great-granddaughter
of Saint Louis. Her father was Pierre, Duc de
Bourbon, and her mother Isabelle, one of the
younger daughters of Charles, Comte de Valois.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Their eldest daughter, Jeanne, was born February
3, 1335, and within a year or so of each other
their second daughter, Blanche, and their son Louis.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
The other daughters were Bonne, Catherine, Marguérite,
Isabelle (?), and Marie.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The Duchesse de Bourbon being a half-sister of
Philippe, and her husband one of his favourite companions,
they spent most of their time and money
also, at Paris, Vincennes, and the other royal palaces
in the gay, brilliant days when first the Valois came
to the throne.</p>

<p>Jeanne was born at Vincennes, and passed her
childhood at that magnificent court over which she
was so early chosen to reign. She was betrothed at
six years old to Amadeo VI. (afterwards called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Green Count) of Savoy.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> With the state and splendour
that surrounded her earliest years were mingled
those national calamities which had already begun to
cast their shadow over the kingdom of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1346}</div>

<p>The Hundred Years’ War had broken out soon
after her birth. The disastrous sea-fight ending in
the total destruction of the French navy, took place
in 1338.</p>

<p>Taxes were high; there had been bad harvests,
bringing famine and pestilence. France was already
less prosperous than she had been under the Capétiens
kings.</p>

<p>The terrors and troubles of the English war must
have left a deep impression on the imagination of the
gentle child, who seems to have been remarkable for
her beauty and sweetness of disposition. She was
between nine and ten years old at the time when the
English host lay encamped near Paris, when gates
and walls were strictly guarded and men were arming
in haste, while fugitives poured into Paris all day,
and the nights were illumined with flames of burning
castles and villages. Her father was in the battle of
Crécy, but returned in safety, and not long afterwards
her little sister Bonne was married to the younger son
of the Duc de Brabant. The Princess Joan, eldest
daughter of the Duc de Normandie, was married on
the same day to the elder son of the Duc de Brabant,
by the desire of the King, who wrote orders that his
granddaughter and niece should be ready on a certain
day to meet the two boys who were to be their husbands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
The ceremony took place, but both the boys
died a little later of the plague. Joan afterwards
became Queen of Navarre, and Bonne Countess of
Savoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1348}</div>

<p>The Duchesse de Bourbon and her children must
have left Paris and returned to their home in the
Bourbonnais, for the Duke wrote there from Paris on
July 22, 1348, to announce to his eldest daughter,
whose engagement to the Comte de Savoie had been
broken off, that her uncle, Gui, Comte de Forez, had
brought proposals of marriage for her from Humbert,
Dauphin du Viennois, which he had accepted. But
the plague was then raging all over the Lyonnais, so
that it was out of the question to run the risk of
travelling at that time. The Duke therefore induced
the Dauphin to consent to the marriage being
deferred for the present. Humbert was scarcely a
suitable husband for Jeanne, who was then eleven
years old, while he was a widower, whose only son
had lost his life by falling from his arms out of a
balcony, as he was playing with him. The shock of
this accident and the loss of his heir had cast a gloom
over the life of the Dauphin, and when a second time
the Duc de Bourbon sought to delay the arrangements
for the marriage, he replied that in that case
he considered himself free from all engagements.
The Duc de Bourbon, on hearing this, went to meet
the Dauphin, and after an interview between the two
princes the negotiations were resumed, in January,
1349, and the middle of February following was fixed
upon for their fulfilment. But whether the desire to
quit the world and seek the consolations of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
in the retirement of the cloister had already taken
strong hold upon his mind, or whether the secret
ambition and intrigues of the French court had any
influence on the matter, it was suddenly given out
that the Dauphin had decided to renounce the world
and enter the order of St. Dominic, and had arranged
for the immediate cession of his estates to the King’s
grandson, Charles, eldest
son of the Duke of Normandy.
Humbert, the last
prince of the house of La
Tour du Pin, had already,
by treaties passed in 1343
and 1344, promised the
Viennois, afterwards known
as Dauphiné, to Philippe,
younger son of Philippe VI.
Then the young Philippe
had been made Duc d’Orléans
instead, and the province
was to go to Jean,
but at last it was given to
the heir of the Duke of
Normandy, and from this
time forth that province, with the title of Dauphin,
was the inheritance of the eldest sons of France. To
the Duc de Bourbon the King offered, instead of
Humbert de la Tour du Pin, his own grandson, for
a son-in-law; an exchange with which it is needless
to say the Duke was well content. The treaty was
signed at Lyon in July, 1349.</p>

  <div class="caption">Jeanne de Bourbon</div></div>

<p>So Jeanne was, after all, to be Dauphine, but her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
husband, instead of a widower old enough to be her
father, was to be a young prince of her own age and
the future King of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1350}</div>

<p>They were married at Vincennes in the following
year, on the 8th of April, 1350, both of them being
about thirteen or fourteen years old. Of course they
were not strangers to each other, for they were
cousins, and had both been brought up at the court
of their grandfather and uncle in Paris, and at that
ancient castle in the deep shade of the forest, where
generations of the children of France<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> had been
born, had played in childhood, grown to manhood
or womanhood, ruled, loved, suffered and died. The
love of the forest and of all beauty in nature and
art lay deep in the heart of the young Dauphin, who
in no way resembled his father or grandfather. That
Philippe and Jean de Valois, the chivalrous King of
Bohemia or the warlike Princes of Burgundy should
have had such a descendant would surely have
seemed impossible at that time and with those surroundings.</p>

<p>Charles had neither inherited the striking beauty
nor the martial tastes of the Valois. He was a quiet,
delicate lad, tall, pale, dark-eyed and rather timid.
He cared very little for riding, and not at all for war
and warlike pastimes, but delighted in study and
literary pursuits. And he adored the Dauphine,
whose bright beauty and charming character made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
her the idol of the court and country. The children
had been attached to one another from the first, and
as they grew older Charles, both as Dauphin and
King, ever turned for sympathy, counsel, or consolation
to Jeanne, whom he called “the light of his eyes
and the sunshine of the kingdom.”</p>

<p>The plague had now abated, and people were
beginning to recover from the fear and depression in
which they had lately been living. The royal family
had suffered severely. The Dauphin had lost his
mother and grandmother; the two little princesses,
sisters of himself and the Dauphine, were widows; the
Queen of Navarre, whose daughter Blanche the King
had just married, was also among the victims of the
pestilence. However, for the present the plague was
over, and those who had escaped now breathed freely
and tried to console themselves in different ways for
the calamities of the last two years. The Duke of
Normandy was married just after his father to the
widowed Comtesse d’Auvergne; there were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fêtes</i> again
at court, and things seemed to be returning to their
usual state. The death of Philippe VI. came as a
sudden shock in the midst of the general rejoicing;
but then followed the coronation of the new King
and Queen, which was celebrated with great magnificence.
On the same day the King knighted his two
eldest sons, the Dauphin, and Louis, afterwards
Duc d’Anjou, his brother Philippe, Duc d’Orléans,
his stepson Philippe, Duc de Bourgogne, his cousins
the Comtes d’Alençon and d’Etampes, and other
young nobles. The King and Queen left Reims on
Monday evening and journeyed by Laon, Soissons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and Senlis to Paris, which they entered in state
on Sunday, the 17th October, after vespers. The
town was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">encourtinée</i>, or hung with costly stuffs, the
artisans were dressed each in the costume of their
own trade, the citizens of the town in costumes like
each other, the Lombards who lived in the city all
wore long parti-coloured silk robes, and on their
heads tall, pointed hats, parti-coloured like their
dresses. “And they followed after each other as was
ordered, some on horseback and some on foot, and
before them went those playing music, to meet the
King, who entered Paris with great joy.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1352}</div>

<p>The court remained at Paris till the feast of St.
Martin in the winter, the time being spent partly in
festivities and partly in business connected with
parliament. On the accession of a new King all the
judicial officers had to be re-invested<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> or they were
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">désappointés</i>; a word which became obsolete in
French, was adopted by the English, and from them
has been re-adopted by the French, but with a
different signification.</p>

<p>“In 1352, on Monday the vigil of the Conception,”
says the Monk of Saint Denis, “the King gave the
duchy of Normandy to Monseigneur Charles, his
eldest son, Dauphin de Vienne et Comte de Poitiers,
and on the next day, Tuesday, the day of the feast
of the Conception beforesaid, Monseigneur Charles
did him homage for it, at the hostel of Maistre Martin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
de Mello, canon of Paris, of the cloister of Notre Dame.”</p>

<p>After which the Prince always called himself Duc
de Normandie, greatly preferring the title to that of
Dauphin.</p>

<p>The Dauphin and Dauphine lived chiefly at Vivier-en-Brie,
a castle in the midst of the woods not far
from Vincennes. This château had been given to the
father of the Dauphin, now King, when he married
his mother, Bonne de Luxembourg, by his grandfather,
Philippe VI. Here the Dauphin afterwards
founded a chantry or chapel with fourteen ecclesiastics
to chant the offices and give opportunity to the
officers who followed the court to perform their
devotions.</p>

<p>Jean, who had been at war with the Spaniards,
considering the constant strife which, with short
intervals of imperfectly observed truce, was always
going on between France and England, was naturally
anxious to conclude a peace with the King of Spain,
whose subjects were extremely desirous that he should
marry a French princess. In 1352 a treaty was
arranged between the two countries, in which this was
one of the clauses; and it was decided that one of the
daughters of the Duc de Bourbon should be selected.
Nieces of the late King of France and sisters of the
future Queen of that country, one of them would be
a suitable wife for their young King. With some
difficulty they induced him to consent, and a Spanish
embassy was despatched to France to conclude the
alliance.</p>

<p>The character of Pedro the Cruel was notorious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
even for the lawless times in which he lived. His
early friend the King of Navarre, though by no means
scrupulous, afterwards abandoned his alliance in
disgust; and although at this time he was not more
than twenty years old, his crimes had already given
him a reputation of which the Duc de Bourbon must
have known quite well. But the King of France had
set his heart upon this alliance, and had promised to
give a dowry of three hundred thousand florins.
Pedro was to settle various castles, towns, and estates
upon the Princess, and the Duke, whose eldest
daughter was to be Queen of France, was well
contented to see the second Queen of Spain. For it
was upon the Princess Blanche that the choice had
fallen. As long as one of his girls wore the crown of
Spain, the Duke did not care which it might be. He
introduced the ambassador into the room where they
all were, so that he might choose.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> And as Blanche,
the eldest next to the Dauphine of France, seemed to
him the most beautiful, he fixed upon her; and the
marriage took place during the summer of that year.</p>

<p>Various entries appear among the accounts of the
royal expenses for splendid presents and rich dresses
purchased “for the marriage of her Majesty the
Queen of Spain.” Blanche, then about fourteen or
fifteen years old, went to Valladolid to meet her
husband. She is said by contemporary historians to
have been beautiful, gentle, and attractive, notwithstanding
which her fate was one of the most tragic
that ever befel a woman sacrificed to political expediency.
The destinies of the French princesses who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
have married Kings of Spain have always seemed
tinged with melancholy and gloom. The intolerable
rigour of that etiquette which reduced the lives of the
Spanish queens to a dignified slavery, the cruelty of
the national amusements, the jealous tyranny and
bigotry of many of the kings, must surely have made
these young girls look back with regret and longing
to the gay court and “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaisant pays de France</i>.” Even
when, as in other cases, the King, however bigoted,
morose, or relentless in general, was really fond of his
wife, the life of a Queen of Spain can scarcely have
been a very cheerful one.</p>

<p>But Blanche de Bourbon was more than usually
unfortunate. Pedro, who came to the throne before
he was sixteen, began by putting to death various
Spanish nobles and gentlemen, and also Eleanor de
Guzman, his late father’s mistress, by whom that King
had had several sons, and for whom the Queen and
her son, the present King, had been slighted and
neglected. He also murdered two or three of his
natural brothers, and it was by the hand of one of
those who escaped from his power that he met the
due reward of his crimes.</p>

<p>The Queen-mother had urged Pedro to revenge her
wrongs and his own upon Eleanor de Guzman; but
when he began not only to imitate but far to surpass
the faults of his father, by taking a Jewess named
Maria de Padilla for his mistress, deserting his young
wife three days after their marriage and keeping her
a prisoner, his mother offered the most strenuous
opposition to his conduct and warmly espoused the
cause of the young Queen, her daughter-in-law. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
was of no avail, however. Blanche was doomed to
wear out her youth in captivity, in one Spanish castle
after another, while Pedro carried on intrigues with
various women, but remained chiefly under the influence
of Maria de Padilla.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1355}</div>

<p>The cause of this iniquity has never been certainly
known. Whether Pedro, having allowed himself to
be persuaded into this marriage against his will,
afterwards regretted it and took this way of revenging
himself; whether he was, as it has been said
actuated by an insane and perfectly groundless
jealousy of his younger brother Don Federico, one
of the sons of Eleanor de Guzman, whom he had
sent to meet Blanche, and whom in a furious rage he
stabbed to the heart; or whether it was simply
owing to the baneful influence of his Jewish mistress,
must remain doubtful. But the story of Blanche de
Bourbon will always be considered one of the most
pathetic tragedies which history records.</p>

<p>Her sisters were more fortunate. Bonne, the third
daughter of the Duc de Bourbon, who had been
married when almost a baby to the younger son of
the Duc de Brabant and had shortly afterwards
become a widow, was married in 1355 to Amadeo
VI., Comte de Savoie, then about twenty-two years
old. He had been betrothed to Jeanne de Bourgogne
sister of the last Capétien Duke, Philippe de Navarre
and then to Jeanne de Bourbon, now Dauphine
elder sister of Bonne. At ten years old he had
succeeded his father, Aimon,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> brother of that Comte
de Savoie who married Blanche de Bourgogne and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
left no heirs male. Amadeo VI. was one of the
greatest princes of his day, both as warrior and
statesman. Bonne de Bourbon, Comtesse de Savoie,
was, says an ancient writer, “an ornament to her century,
and her goodness caused her to be admired on
all occasions.” The wedding was celebrated at Paris
in August, and the young Countess set off for Savoy,
where she reigned for many years in prosperity and
honour. Her life was chequered with many sorrows
and also beset by many difficulties, which she surmounted
with courage and capacity. As Regent of
Savoy during the latter part of her life, she was
held in high esteem. She died in the Château de
Mâcon in 1402.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1356}</div>

<p>In September, 1356, came the disastrous battle of
Poitiers. To Jeanne, as to everybody else in France,
that must have been a time of fearful anxiety and
suspense. Those nearest and dearest to her were
with the army; and although the sight of the gallant
host that followed the King in such splendid array
to meet the enemy might well have filled the hearts
of those they left behind with pride and confidence,
there was still the remembrance of the time when
Paris had waited in breathless expectation for news
of Philippe de Valois and his chivalrous army while
those who were not prisoners or scattered over the
land lay dead on the field of Crécy.</p>

<p>And when tidings came of a defeat more terrible
than the former&mdash;of the fall of the oriflamme, of the
capture of the King and his youngest son by an
enemy so inferior in numbers, Jeanne also heard of
her father’s death on the field of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Pierre, Duc de Bourbon, had died like a brave
soldier by the side of the King, whom he shielded
from the blows aimed at him. But he had disregarded
the commands of the Church, issued at the
persuasion of his creditors, that he should pay his
debts, and was therefore considered as an excommunicated
person, to whom no one dared give
Christian burial without permission.</p>

<p>His son and successor, Louis II., undertook to
satisfy all claims, and his body was then removed
from the convent of the Jacobins at Poitiers, where it
had been carried after the battle, to that of the
same religious order at Paris.</p>

<p>There the Duc de Bourbon was buried near his
father, and his lands and honours passed to his son,
known to history as “the good Duke, Louis de
Bourbon.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> captivity of the King and the flight of the
Queen, who took refuge with her two children
in her son’s duchy of Burgundy, placed Charles and
Jeanne at the head of the court and kingdom. The
Dauphin, or, as he preferred to call himself, the Duc
de Normandie, assumed the government, and, in consideration
of his youth, a council was appointed to
assist him. Confusion and dismay had taken possession
of the country. The three estates were convoked
to deliberate on the means to be adopted to provide
the ransom of the King. They sat for a fortnight in
the hôtel of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Frères Mineurs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> but Etienne Marcel,
at the head of a strong party, demanded the redress
of various grievances, and amongst others the immediate
release of the King of Navarre, then imprisoned
at Arleux. No conclusion, however, was arrived at;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the estates were dissolved and Charles summoned the
three estates of the Languedoc, or southern part of
France, but without much more success.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> In December
he went to Metz to see his uncle, the son of the
King of Bohemia, now the Emperor Charles IV., to
take counsel with him; leaving his brother Louis
lieutenant at Paris in his place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1357}</div>

<p>Charles IV. had been brought up in the court of
Philippe de Valois; his sister, Bonne, had been the
first wife of Jean, and he regarded the Valois family
with strong affection. But he was too much like
them to be of any use as an adviser, although he is
said to have reproached his nephew with having, at
this time of general distress, ordered for himself a
new and splendid crown of gold. He, and probably
the Duchesse de Normandie, spent Christmas with
their uncle amidst a succession of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fêtes</i>, and returned
to Paris towards the end of January to find the discontent
of the people increased; which was not surprising,
for there had been a still further depreciation
of the coin of the realm; the seigneurs and knights
who had been taken prisoners at Poitiers were returning
in crowds to collect their ransoms, which were
enormously heavy, and as the Jews and Lombards had
been banished they could not borrow money on usury
from them, as they might otherwise have done, so that
there was no way of getting it but to wring it out of
the peasants. As there was scarcely a family that
had not at least one member a prisoner, a system of
universal extortion was going on. They seized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
property of their vassals and in many cases endeavoured,
by imprisonment and other cruelty, to force
them to give up any money they supposed them to
have concealed,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> in order that it might be sent to the
English to buy back those, many of whom they did
not at all wish to see.</p>

<p>And they were profoundly irritated by this new
misfortune. At Crécy, at any rate, they grumbled,
every one had fought bravely and done their best; no
shadow of dishonour had rested on the lilies of
France. The nobles might have been proud and
extortionate, but in the hour of danger they did not
flinch. They lay in heaps on the field of battle, and
a life of extravagance and dissipation was redeemed
by a hero’s death.</p>

<p>But now there were suspicions of panic; there
had been confusion and mismanagement, and there
appeared to be an extraordinary number of prisoners.
The early flight of four out of the five young princes
also displeased the people, who now began to despise
the nobles whom hitherto they had only feared and
hated. And whereas it had formerly been the
custom for them to serve the King in time of war at
their own cost and without pay, they had, in the reign
of Philippe de Valois, begun to demand money while
in the field, and the sums granted by Philippe had to
be increased by Jean just at the time when they
seemed to be least deserved.</p>

<p>The Hundred Years’ War between France and England
in the fourteenth century was destructive to the
prosperity and civilisation which, in spite of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
drawbacks, had characterised the thirteenth. There
could be no liberty while the country was full of
armed bands led by powerful barons; agriculture was
not likely to flourish in such a state of things as has
been described; the nobles had no leisure to encourage
or interest themselves in literary pursuits
while their whole lives were spent in warfare. It was
in the monasteries that learning was chiefly cultivated
and protected, but many of those great religious
establishments in the country, though always possessing
some sort of fortification, had been sacked and
burned by brigands, and others deserted by their
inhabitants, who no longer found that security which
the cloister had formerly afforded. The towns had
become less free, and many of them had lost the
liberties and privileges accorded them by the Capétiens
Kings. For the Valois and their followers held the
traders and unwarlike citizens in the deepest contempt,
and so, as time went on, grew and strengthened
a bitter hatred of the lower classes for those of gentle
blood, making men the deadly enemies of their own
countrymen and causing national calamities far more
dreadful and disgraceful than any brought about by
foreign invaders.</p>

<p>In other countries nobles and people, united in their
sentiments and aspirations, developed in peaceful and
harmonious progress to the accomplishment of their
destinies;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> whilst in France the deplorable separation
that began in the fourteenth century caused the
frightful excesses of the Jacquerie, and having produced
the Reign of Terror in the days of our great-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>grandfathers
and the Commune in our own, is still so
fatal an injury to the power, stability, and prestige of
the French nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1358}</div>

<p>The first child of the Duke and Duchess of
Normandy was born in September of this year (1357),
a daughter, named Jeanne.</p>

<p>It was on the 28th of May, 1358,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> that the Jacquerie,
or rising of the peasants, broke out at the little town
of Saint-Leu, where a number of labourers, joined by
small tradesmen, artisans, and other persons of the
lower classes, assembled in revolt; and having
murdered nine gentlemen who happened to be in the
town, spread themselves over the surrounding country,
putting to death every man, woman, and child of good
blood who came in their way, and plundering and
burning the châteaux. They attacked the villages at
each end of the forest of Ermenonville, and went to
the castle of Beaumont-sur-Oise, where the Duchesse
d’Orléans then was. Warned just in time of the
approach of the murderers, she fled for her life, was
out of the castle before they arrived and set it on
fire, and escaped to Meaux, a town on the Marne,
where the Duchess of Normandy, the Princess Isabelle
de France and more than three hundred ladies had
taken refuge, some having escaped in their nightdresses
without having had time to dress themselves.</p>

<p>The rebellion spread rapidly over Picardy, Champagne,
and the Ile-de-France, and the horrors of it
have never been equalled in any Christian country.
It was like a revolt of savages. Hordes of bloodthirsty
miscreants went about burning castles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
murdering and torturing men, women, and children.
None who fell into their power might escape dishonour
and death; any village refusing to join them
was exposed to their vengeance.</p>

<p>A band of three thousand Jacques having just
destroyed the Château de Poix, were marching on
Aumale when they met a hundred and twenty Norman
and Picards men-at-arms, led by Guillaume de
Picquigny. The latter came forward to parley with
them but was treacherously slain by one Jean Petit
Cardaine. His followers fell upon the Jacques, killed
two thousand of them, and put the remainder to
flight. The Jacques had cause to repent of this
murder, for Guillaume de Picquigny was a relation
of that Jean de Picquigny who delivered the King
of Navarre from Arleux. And Charles of Navarre,
who was always ready to protect his friends and
punish his enemies, took ample vengeance for his
death. The Château d’Ermenonville belonged to
Robert de Lorris, who had risen from humble life
in the village from which he took his name. It is a
mistaken notion that in the middle ages people could
not and did not rise from the ranks to the highest
social position. It was, of course, less frequent than
in our own days, but in the fourteenth century there
were hundreds of cases of the kind, both ecclesiastic
and secular.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Robert de Lorris was one of them. He was a
great authority on French law, and a favourite both
of Philippe de Valois and Jean, by whom he had been
ennobled, made Chamberlain, Vicomte de Montreuil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and Seigneur d’Ermenonville. The Jacques besieged,
took, and plundered the Château d’Ermenonville, and
the chamberlain only saved his own life and those of
his wife and children by renouncing his nobility and
declaring himself one of the people.</p>

<p>The atrocities of the Jacquerie did not, fortunately,
extend over the whole of France. An attempt was
made to produce an insurrection at Caen by one
Pierre de Montfort, who paraded the streets with
the model of a plough in his hat, proclaiming himself
a Jacque, and calling on the people to follow
him. This, luckily for themselves, they had too
much sense to do, and Pierre de Montfort was
soon afterwards slain by three burghers whom he
had insulted.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The rebellion was worst about Amiens, Compiègne,
Senlis, Beauvais, and Soissons. The Jacques made
an attack upon Compiègne, but were repulsed by the
inhabitants and some nobles who had taken refuge in
the town. The atrocities committed all over that
part of the country which was the scene of the revolt
were too frightful to relate. Hundreds of castles were
burnt, an immense amount of property destroyed, and
numbers of men, women, and children tortured, dishonoured,
and slain.</p>

<p>The leader of the Jacques, Guillaume Cale, is said
to have disapproved of the most horrible of the excesses
of his followers, but to have been unable to
restrain them. And Etienne Marcel, with many of
the bourgeois of his party, encouraged and gave
assistance to these miscreants, though forbidding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
murder of women and children, which of course he
was powerless to prevent. But a letter of remission
given subsequently to one Jaquin de Chennevières
expressly declares that he had orders from the Prévôt
to burn and destroy the châteaux of Beaumont-sur-Oise,
Bethemont, Javerny, Montmorency, Enghien,
Chaton, and all the houses and fortresses of the
nobles between the Seine and the Oise, from Chaton
to Beaumont.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>And whatever may be our opinion of the policy of
the celebrated Prévôt des Marchands, the murder of
the Marshals of Normandy and Champagne (which
had already taken place in the presence of the
Dauphin) and the assistance he rendered to these
wretches are stains which neither good intentions
nor expediency can excuse.</p>

<p>Jeanne meanwhile, and her companions, were in the
most awful peril. The smaller bourgeoisie, as a rule,
hated the gentlemen and sympathised with the
Jacques. The Mayor of Meaux, Jean Soulas, was
on their side. The gentlemen with them were few
in number, the Jacques were coming, and the Duc
de Normandie had, a short time before, taken sudden
possession of the Marché de Meaux, to the great
discontent of the inhabitants of that town. The
Mayor had even had the insolence to say to the
Comte de Joigny, whom the Duke had sent to
perform this duty, that if he had known what he
came for he should never have set foot in the place.
Informed of this insubordination the Regent had
reprimanded and fined the Mayor, which only increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
his hostility. However, he and the principal
officials and burghers had sworn to be faithful to the
Regent, and not to allow anything to be done to
injure him, and Charles had left Meaux some time
in May, leaving his wife and the rest of the ladies
in the Marché with a much smaller garrison to protect
them than he would have done had he realised the
treachery and disloyalty of Soulas and his friends.
The Duc d’Orléans was there, the Bègue de Vilaine,
the Sires de Trocy and Revel, Héron de Mail,
Philippe d’Aulnoy, Regnaud d’Arcy, and Louis de
Chambly called Le Borgne.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Regent quitted Meaux when discord
and strife broke out between the inhabitants,
led by the Mayor, and the nobles shut up in the
Marché. The exasperated bourgeois laid siege to
the fortress and sent to Paris to ask for assistance,
at the same time summoning all the peasants in the
neighbourhood to join them in attacking the Marché.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>They were not slow in answering to the invitation.
From all parts of the country round they came
swarming to Meaux. The Prévôt des Marchands
had responded to their appeal by sending Pierre
Gilles, a grocer of Paris and one of the leaders of
the insurrection, with a body of armed men from
Paris to Meaux. He knew the Regent was absent
and the garrison weak, and thought the Marché
would fall into their hands by assault. Pierre
Gilles and his troop burned all the châteaux on
their way, and forced the inhabitants of the villages
through which they passed to join them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
The Mayor and burghers threw open the gates,
and about nine thousand furious ruffians, armed
with scythes, pitchforks, and knives, rushed into the
town.</p>

<p>The towns people received them with open arms,
supplied them with abundance of food and wine, which
excited them to still greater ferocity, and joined in the
tumult of fearful shouts and cries as the bloodthirsty
savages swarmed through the streets looking up with
murderous eyes to the towers and walls of the
Marché.</p>

<p>Now the Marché de Meaux was on an island
formed by the Marne, which flowed on one side
of it, and a canal that went round it, coming out
of the river on one side of the Marché and going
back into it on the other. On the side of Meaux
there was a bridge over the Marne from the Marché
to the town, and on the opposite side of the Marché
another bridge, across the canal to the other shore.
Most fortunately, the Dauphin had recently caused
the island to be strongly fortified, and his having done
so now saved his wife and sister from a horrible death.
All round the Marché were high strong walls and
towers. Trees could be seen above the parapet
inside, and the ground rose high in the middle. It
was a strong place, but they were so few to defend
it against the furious hordes outside. In it were the
young Dauphine, the Princess Isabelle de France,
daughter of the King, then about ten or eleven
years old; Blanche de France, Duchesse d’Orléans,
who had just escaped from Beaumont-sur-Oise; and,
as was before said, at least three hundred women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
girls, and children of the noblest families in France.
The gates were closed, the walls guarded as well as
could be done with their few defenders, but the
position grew every moment more alarming. The
streets were crowded to overflowing with these bloodthirsty
wretches, and all down them were spread
tables with bread, meat and wine for their refreshment.
All over the town they were thronging and
feasting, while their horrible cries and brutal threats
rose to the ears of the besieged women and children
who waited in terror and despair, all hope of deliverance
seeming to be at an end.</p>

<p>The fortress was always attacked from the town
side, and from this direction, when the Jacques had
finished feasting, the assault would certainly come.</p>

<p>But the Marché was fortunately not surrounded by
the town. On the other side, across the canal, lay
the open country of Brie. And suddenly a troop of
men in armour was seen approaching at full speed.
It was Gaston, Comte de Foix, and Jean de Grailly,
Captal de Buch, two of the most famous soldiers in
France, with about sixty lances, who rode under the
gateway into the beleaguered fortress, and were received
with acclamations by those within its walls.
The troop was a small one, but a few tried soldiers
under such leaders counted for more than hundreds of
the rabble outside, and the Dauphine and her companions
must have felt that they were saved.</p>

<p>Having no particular fighting to do just then, the
two knights had employed their leisure in an expedition
against some heathen tribes still to be found in
Prussia; and on their way back, passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Châlons, had heard of what was going on at Meaux
and of the perilous position of the ladies shut up in
the Marché. The Comte de Foix was brother-in-law
of the King of Navarre; and the Captal de Buch,
a Gascon gentleman, was a subject and follower of
King Edward of England. Etienne Marcel, on the
other hand, was a strong partisan of Charles of
Navarre. But the project of the bourgeois prévôt to
throw the wives and children of French gentlemen
into the power of a mob of brutal savages was not
likely to recommend itself to the two knights, who
at once turned their horses’ heads towards Meaux,
and pushed on with desperate haste to save the
Marché before it fell. The white banner still floated
from its walls,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> but they were only just in time.
The Jacques, having done feasting, now ranged themselves
in order of battle, and in immense numbers,
with frightful yells, pressed towards the Marché and
began the attack. The shrieks of the terrified women
and children mingled with the tumult outside,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> but
Jean de Grailly and Gaston de Foix ordered the
gate on the side of the town to be thrown open.
Then, raising the pennon of the Captal and the
banners of Orléans and Foix, they rushed out and
fell upon the enemy. Down to the bridge they rode,
over which was thronging a multitude like ferocious
wild beasts. But before the charge of the knights
the Jacques went down in heaps; those behind them
hesitated, then drew back and fled before the cavaliers,
who pursued them with levelled lances and drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
swords through the streets of the town. Several of
the nobles were killed, amongst others Louis de
Chambly, called Le Borgne, but thousands of the
Jacques were slain. Many of the citizens of Meaux
were killed in the battle that raged all over the city;
the rest were carried prisoners to the citadel. Jean
Soulas, the traitorous mayor, was taken during the
fighting and hanged when it was over. The nobles
then set fire to the town, which was burning for a
fortnight. The royal château, with many houses and
churches, perished in the flames. Froissart says that
seven thousand Jacques were killed. The inhabitants
of Meaux, “for their detestable deed,” were declared
guilty of high treason, and the town condemned to
be and for ever remain uninhabited. The Regent,
in consideration of the Dean and Chapter of Meaux,
and at the petition of some other towns who interceded
with him on behalf of the place, afterwards
remitted this sentence. But the commune of Meaux
was suppressed and united to the prévôté de Paris.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Jeanne and her companions watched from the
Marché the victory of their friends and the destruction
of their enemies, and it must soon have been
evident to them that their danger was at an end.
The destruction of the Jacques on that day, June
9, 1358, arrested the course of the rebellion. The
nobles scoured the country, putting to death all
the Jacques they could find. Learning that some
of them had taken refuge at Sens, they resolved to
inflict on that city the same punishment as on Meaux,
and for that purpose a party of them, on the 13th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of June, presented themselves at the Paris gate of
the town, demanding the keys in the name of the
Regent. But the inhabitants had received notice
beforehand of what was intended, and had taken
measures accordingly. Therefore, when the nobles,
having been admitted, and thinking themselves
masters of the place, advanced with drawn swords
and cries of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ville gagnée! ville prise!</i>” the citizens,
and even those nobles who belonged to Sens, pushed
down from the top of the street, which was very steep,
carts with scythes fastened to the wheels which they
had prepared for the purpose, while armed men issued
from the houses, and women threw stones, lime, and
boiling water from the windows, by which means
some were killed and the rest escaped out of the city.</p>

<p>But the defeat at Meaux broke the head of the
insurrection. From the terror, the slaughter, and the
discouragement of that day the Jacques never recovered,
and the finishing stroke was given by the
King of Navarre, on whose support some of them
had been foolish enough to reckon, because of his
hostility to the King and Dauphin.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of Normandy and Picardy sent an
invitation to Charles de Navarre, who was then at
his castle at Longueville, to be their leader in this
contest; he “who was the first gentleman in the
world.”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The King of Navarre was ready enough. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
placed himself at the head of four hundred lances,
and by the time he came up with the Jacques, near
Clermont, his troop had increased to a thousand men,
many of whom were English. The Jacques were
put to flight with great slaughter, and their leader,
Guillaume Cale, put to death. Some say that he
was arrested by treachery; at any rate Charles of
Navarre declared that the Jacques were furious wild
beasts, with whom it was not possible to treat or
make any terms. The Regent had been in arms ever
since the insurrection had broken out, and the attack
upon his wife rendered it more hateful to him.</p>

<p>The Jacquerie was soon at an end; it only lasted
about a month, and when once the nobles had recovered
from the surprise and shock of its outbreak, it
was put down and punished with tremendous severity.
Pierre Gilles was beheaded at the Halles on the 4th
of August. He appears to have been a man of
considerable wealth, and in the inventory of his
merchandise was a large quantity of sugar in loaves
and in powder from Cairo, or, as it was called,
Babylon. It came chiefly from Egypt at that time.</p>

<p>That part of Champagne, Ile-de-France, and other
districts which had been the scene of these atrocities
of the Jacques, was so devastated with fire and sword
that for some time it remained almost without inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
The towns and villages which had taken
part in the Jacquerie were heavily fined, as may be
seen by the records in the “Trésor des Chartes.”
Chavanges, for instance, was fined a thousand gold
florins.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
A note, tome vi. p. 117, of the “Grandes Chroniques
de France,” M. Paulin Paris, makes the following
remarks and gives the following quotation
respecting the complicity of Etienne Marcel in the
Jacquerie, and the fallacious hopes in which the
rebels indulged with regard to the King of <span class="locked">Navarre:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“C’est que ces Marseillais du XIV<sup>me</sup> siécle avoient
été bien réellement soulevés par les anarchistes de
Paris. Je demande la permission de citer à l’appui
de cette opinion la précieuse chronique manuscrite
conservée sous le No. 530, Supplément françois. A
l’occasion de l’expédition du roi de Navarre contre
les Jacques, on y lit: En ce temps assembla le roy de
Navarre grans gens et ala vers Clermont-en-Beauvoisie,
et en tuêrent plus de huit cens et fist copper
la teste à leur cappitaine qui se vouloit tenir pour roy;
et dient aucuns que les Jacques s’attendoient que le
roy de Navarre leur deust aidier, pour l’alliance, qu’il
avoit au prévost des marchans, par lequel prévost la
Jacquerie s’esmeut, si comme on dit.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Duchess of Normandy and her friends
were now free, after the horrible experience
of the last few days. The enemy was destroyed, the
revolt quelled, and the town, at which they could
hardly have looked without shuddering, was half
burnt down and deserted; for the inhabitants, who
had so lately been raging and clamouring for their
blood, were either slain or carried away prisoners.
The Duchesse d’Orléans, after this second narrow
escape within a few days, set off on her journey
towards Paris, which was still in a disturbed state,
and in the neighbourhood of which her mother,
Queen Jeanne d’Evreux, was busy trying, as she repeatedly
did, to patch up a peace between the Duke
of Normandy and the King of Navarre, who, although
he hated and put down the Jacquerie, was a friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
and ally of Etienne Marcel and had a powerful party
at Paris.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Normandy stayed on for a short
time in the fortress of Meaux, waiting for her husband
to join her.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July peace was concluded by the
efforts of Queen Jeanne d’Evreux, assisted by the
young Queen of Navarre, sister of the Duke of
Normandy, the Archbishop of Beauvais, and two
or three others. The interview took place at Charenton
on the Seine, where the Dauphin caused a bridge
of boats to be constructed for the occasion.</p>

<p>He then joined the Dauphine at Meaux. The
danger in which Jeanne had been and the insult involved
in the attack upon her had naturally enraged
him against every one in any way connected with
the revolt; but various letters of remission to those
concerned in it, on several occasions granted to
persons forced against their will to take part in it,
were signed by him about this time. Meanwhile,
reports of the diminishing strength of Etienne Marcel
and his party kept arriving from Paris; with invitations
to Charles to return and take possession of the
capital.</p>

<p>At last came tidings of the death of the prévôt,
struck down at night as he was in the act of changing
the guard and placing the keys of Paris in the hands
of the King of Navarre. His adherents were immediately
scattered, imprisoned, or slain, and the
royalists sent urgent entreaties to the Duke of
Normandy, who lost no time in setting off for Paris,
which he entered on the evening of Thursday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
August 2nd, amidst the acclamations of the people
and the illuminations and rejoicings prepared to
welcome him.</p>

<p>The next day he sent a messenger to Jeanne with
the news of this successful state of affairs, directing
her to join him at Paris with the ladies of her court.
When she arrived there she found the Duc de
Normandie waiting for her at the Louvre, where they
took up their abode and where for some time they
lived in peace. The King was still a prisoner, and
the Regent, freed from the constant enmity of
Etienne Marcel, endeavoured to repair the misfortunes
that had happened and to get the affairs
of the State somewhat into order. The truce with
England was soon to expire, but he made another
treaty of peace with the King of Navarre, and contrived
to win to his side the young Comte de
Harcourt, Jean III., who, since the execution of his
father by the King of France in the affair of Rouen,
had been fighting against that country in the ranks
of England and Navarre.</p>

<p>The Dauphin, however, succeeded in making friends
with him, and although the precedent of Charles of
Navarre was not very encouraging, he tried to
attach the Comte de Harcourt to his interests by
marrying him to Catherine, one of the Dauphine’s
sisters. The wedding took place in October, at the
Louvre.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>The favourite monastic order of Charles and
Jeanne appears to have been that of the Céléstins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
It will be remembered that Saint Louis brought from
the Holy Land some Carmelites, sometimes called
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Barrés</i> because of the striped robes or mantles they
used at first to wear; and that in the reign of
Philippe-le-Long they sold their monastery, or
rather the ground on which it stood, to one Jacques
Marcel, a citizen of Paris, reserving to themselves all
building materials, carved stones, columns, woodwork,
and tombs, with the bones of those buried therein;
all to be transported by midsummer day to the
new place which had been chosen for the larger
and more convenient monastery which they now
required.</p>

<p>But before they left their old home, the Carmelites,
assisted by an agent of the Bishop, carefully pointed
out to the new owner those parts which were consecrated
ground, and Jacques Marcel, “who was a good
man, and feared God,” built two chapels upon them,
just at the entrance to the garden, and appointed and
endowed two chaplains to serve them.</p>

<p>Jacques Marcel was buried in a tomb of black marble
in one of these chapels, and the place went to his son,
Garnier Marcel, in 1320.</p>

<p>Now there was a young man named Robert de
Jussi, who had been a novice in the Céléstin monastery
of St. Pierre, in the forest of Cuisse, not far from
Compiègne. But after he had been there a year, his
parents by their entreaties and importunity persuaded
him to renounce the monastic life and return to the
world. Philippe de Valois, who was then king, took
a fancy to him, attracted by his talents, good sense,
and piety. He chose him, while still very young, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
be one of his secretaries; and so well did he serve the
King and so great was the reputation he acquired at
court for his judgment and conduct, that he remained
Secretary of State and one of the most distinguished
members of Council under Philippe de Valois, Jean,
and Charles V., Dauphin. But his worldly success
and prosperity did not make him forget the convent
in the forest, the holy lessons and examples of the
good fathers, and the peaceful days he had spent with
them. He spoke of them to the Dauphin, who sent
for some of them to come from their monastery to
Paris in 1352, when Garnier Marcel presented them
with the site of the old Carmelite monastery which
had been bought by his father; where they established
themselves. Charles both as Dauphin and King
showed unvarying kindness and affection to this
brotherhood, visiting the convent frequently, and
conversing familiarly with the brethren. In this
year (1358), seeing that they were in need of help,
he granted them a purse of money from the Chancery
of France, to be given yearly, and as a proof of his
friendship carried the first to them himself, and
distributed its contents with his own hands. He
afterwards built them a church, and conferred upon
them many other benefits.</p>

<p>A curious law made at this time, which in our own
days many of us would gladly see re-established,
was, that if a tailor or dressmaker spoilt a dress,
either by cutting the material badly or by ignorance,
so that by their fault it did not fit, they should pay
to the owner of the said garment whatever was the
value of it, and besides that should pay a fine of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
<em>solz</em>, of which three should go to the King and two to
the confraternity.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1359}</div>

<p>Also that if any one made a doublet to sell, and
made it of bad or common thread or stuff, the doublet
should be burnt, and the maker should pay six <em>solz</em> to
the King and four to the confraternity.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>“On Sunday, the nineteenth day of May,” says the
chronicler, “was made a convocation at Paris of the
church, the nobles, and the fortified towns,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> by letters
of monseigneur the regent, to hear a certain treaty of
peace which had been proposed in England between
the Kings of France and of England. Which treaty
had been brought to the regent by Monseigneur
Guillaume de Meleun, Archbishop of Sens, by the
Comte de Tanquarville, brother of the said Archbishop,
by the Comte de Dampmartin, and by
Messire Arnoul d’Odenham, Marshal of France, all
prisoners of the English. On which day came few
people, partly because they had not been told soon
enough of the said convocation, and also because the
roads were infested by the English and Navarrais,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
who held fortresses on every road by which one could
go to Paris; and also because of the robbers who held
French fortresses and were not much better than the
English. And the whole kingdom was covered
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">semé</i>) with them, so that one could not go about the
country. The said English and Navarrais held the
castle of Meleun, the island and all the town on the
side towards Bièvre; and the part towards Brie was
French. <em>Item</em>, they held la Ferté-Soubs-Juerre,
Oysseri, Nogent-l’Artaut, and at least five or six
fortresses on the river Marne; in Brie they held
Becoisel and La Houssoie. In Mucien they held
Juilly, Creil, and several other places on the river
Oyse; on and about the Seine, Poissy, Meullent,
Mante, Rais; and more than a hundred others in
different parts, as well in Picardie as elsewhere.
Which day of the nineteenth was continually put off
in the expectation of more people until the following
Saturday, the twenty-fifth day of the said month.</p>

<p>“On the which Saturday the said regent was at
the palace on the marble staircase in the court; and
there, in presence of all the people, he caused the
treaty to be read by Maistre Guillaume des Dormares,
advocate of the King in parliament, by the which
treaty it appeared that the King of England asked
for the duchy of Normandy, the duchy of Guienne,
the city and castle of Saintes, with all the diocese and
country; the cities of Agen, Tarbes, Pierregort,
Limoges, Caours, with all the diocese and country;
the counties of Bigorre, Poitiers, Anjou, and Maine;
the city and castle of Tours, and all the diocese and
country of Touraine; the counties of Boulogne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Guines, and Pontieu; the town of Monstrueil-sur-Mer
and all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chastellenies</i>; the town of Calais and
all the land of Merq, without the King of England
being, on account of the said lands, in any way subject
either to the present King of France or to his
successors, but only a neighbour. And besides, the
said King of England desired to have the homage
and sovereignty of the duchy of Brittany for ever, the
same as the other lands before mentioned.</p>

<p>“Besides this he asked for four millions of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">escus de
Philippe</i>, with all the lands that he held in the
kingdom of France, upon such condition that the
King of France should make recompense of other
lands to all those who had anything on the said lands,
by alienation made by the Kings of France, or by
those who claimed any rights transmitted by them,
since the said lands and countries belonged to the
Kings of France.</p>

<p>“And also required the said English to be put into
possession of the towns and castles of Rouen, Caen,
Vernon, Pont-de-l’Arche, Goulet, Gisors, Moliniaux,
Arques, Gaillart, Vire, Boulogne, Monstrueil-sur-Mer,
and la Rochelle; a hundred thousand pounds sterling
and ten seigneurs for hostages on the first of August
following. And this done, he would return the King
of France to his kingdom and power, but in all
manner a loyal prisoner until the above-named things
were accomplished.</p>

<p>“Which treaty was very displeasing to the people
of France (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fu moult deplaisant</i>). And after they had
deliberated, they replied to the said regent that the
said treaty was neither bearable nor possible (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">n’estoit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
passable né faisable</i>); and therefore they ordered good
war to be made upon the English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1360}</div>

<p>“<em>Item.</em> Sunday, the second day of June following,
it was granted to the regent that the nobles should
serve him for a month at their own expense, each
according to his estate, without counting coming nor
going. And that the impositions ordered should be
paid by the fortified towns. The clergy offered to
pay the said impositions; the town of Paris offered
six hundred swords, three hundred archers, and a
thousand brigands. And it was ordered that all those
who were there should return to their towns, because
they could not grant anything without speaking to
their towns, and that they should send their answers
on the Monday after Trinity. And afterwards several
towns sent their answer: but because the flat country
was all spoiled by the English and Navarrais enemies,
and also by the garrisons of the French fortresses, the
said fortified towns (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonnes villes</i>) could not fulfil the
number of twelve thousand swords (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">glaives</i>) which
had been granted him by the Langue d’oc.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Normandy had still no
son, but another daughter, the Princess Bonne, had
been born to them.</p>

<p>The war with England had gone on all the winter,
but in the spring of 1360 new proposals of peace
were made, and this time accepted. By the treaty
signed at Bretigny, May 8, 1360, King Edward
renounced his claim to the crown of France, and
also to the duchy of Normandy and all the inheritance
of the Plantagenets north of the Loire. But the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of France ceded to him, no longer as fiefs, but in
absolute sovereignty, Poitou, Aquitaine, with all the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arrière-fiefs</i> appertaining to it from the Loire to the
Pyrenees, and a ransom of three millions of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">écus d’or</i>,
to be paid in sums of four hundred thousand <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">écus</i>
annually.</p>

<p>Six English knights were sent to Paris by King
Edward, in presence of whom the Dauphin was to
swear to the treaty in the most solemn manner.
Therefore, when Mass was sung, after the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Agnus Dei</i>,
Charles, who was then in the Hôtel de Sens, came out
of his oratory and took the oath before the altar.
Then, from a window of the Hôtel de Sens, peace
was proclaimed by a sergeant-at-arms, “the regent
went to Notre-Dame de Paris to return thanks for
the said peace, and then they chanted the <i>Te Deum</i>,
and rang the bells very solemnly.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>King Edward is said to have been induced to make
peace by a frightful storm which overtook his army
near Chartres, killing six thousand horses and a
thousand cavaliers, amongst whom were the heirs
of Warwick and Morley. Thinking that the anger
of God was roused against him because of the
misery and devastation he was causing, he vowed to
put an end to the war.</p>

<p>All over the country the news spread that peace
was signed, and in spite of the hard conditions there
was a general burst of rejoicing. In the villages and
towns church bells rang, thanksgivings were offered,
and festivities of all kinds went on everywhere;
except in some of the towns and provinces transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
to England, who declared that they might
yield homage to the English with their lips, but in
their hearts never.</p>

<p>To the Princess Isabelle de France the return of
the King can have been no subject of congratulation.
She was his third daughter, her sisters being the
Queen of Navarre and Marie, afterwards Duchesse de
Bar. The fourth sister had taken the veil at Poissy,
and died the year after in early childhood (1352).</p>

<p>In the deplorable state of the country, it was most
difficult to obtain the money required to pay the first
instalment of the King’s ransom. Galeazzo Visconti,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vicomte et Prince de Milan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> offered to give 600,000
florins in exchange for the Princess Isabelle, whom he
was anxious to marry to his son, Giovanni. The
Visconti were amongst the richest and most powerful
of the princes of Italy. They ruled over Milan and
the greater part of Lombardy. The two brothers,
Galeazzo and Bernabo, chiefs of the family, were
stained with countless crimes and cruelties. Of
Giovanni nothing could be said, as he was only
ten years old. The Princess Isabelle was not quite
twelve, but she seems to have had her own ideas, and
she hated this Italian marriage. It was no use. The
Visconti were eager for the alliance of the King of
France, and willing to pay for the honour. King
Jean wanted the money, and had been ready to sign
the utterly ruinous treaty at first proposed and sacrifice
France to gain his own liberty; so that he was not
likely to hesitate. The French people did not like
the marriage, and there was a murmuring all over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
country against the King for selling his own blood.
But the preparations were hurried on, and the Princess
was sent to Italy before the end of that summer, with
a splendid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i>.</p>

<p>Villani gives an account of the magnificence of the
entertainments given in her honour at the palaces of
Galeazzo and Bernabo in Milan. He says she arrived
in regal state, splendidly dressed, and received the
homage of all before her marriage, but after that, notwithstanding
her royal blood, she did reverence to
Galeazzo and Bernabo and their wives,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> the former of
whom was a Princess of Savoy.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The splendid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fêtes</i> went on for three days and nights
in the stately beautiful Italian palaces, which so far
surpass those of other lands. Every day there were
banquets, where at the chief table dined a thousand
guests, princes, ambassadors, nobles and representatives
of the citizens. There were jousts in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortile</i> or courtyard of the palace of Galeazzo, ladies
looking on from the windows and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">loggie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The last
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fête</i> was given by Bernabo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King of France, whose freedom had
been bought in exchange for his daughter, had been
conducted by the Black Prince to Calais, in the castle
of which a great supper was given in his honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
by King Edward, whose sons, with the Duke of
Lancaster and the chief barons of England, served
bareheaded at the table, and after two days spent at
Boulogne in religious ceremonies and festivities King
Edward embarked for England, and Jean prepared to
return to Paris.</p>

<p>Besides the public misfortunes of this time, a great
sorrow befel the Duke and Duchess of Normandy in
the death of their two little daughters, Jeanne and
Bonne, whom their mother had dedicated to God if
the King returned. The historian says God apparently
accepted the gift.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The eldest was about
three years old. The former died October 21st at
the abbey of St. Antoine des Champs, at Paris, where
she had been placed in order to be dedicated to
religion, and her little sister rather less than three
weeks after her. They were both buried in the church
of that abbey, where their effigies in white marble
were placed, lying upon their black marble tomb.
This grief was all the more bitter to Charles and Jeanne
as these were their only children. The chronicler
remarks of this event: “Item, on Thursday, the
11th November, were buried the two daughters of
the Duke of Normandy, at St. Antoine, near Paris,
and was present the said Duke at the funeral, very
troubled, for he had no more children.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Among those
chosen to go to England with King Edward were
Louis Duc d’Anjou and Jean Duc de Berry, second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
and third sons of the King, to whom their father had
given these two duchies by way of compensation;
Philippe, Duc d’Orléans, the King’s brother; Louis,
Duc de Bourbon; Pierre d’Alençon and Jean, brother
to the Comte d’Etampes, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tous des fleurs-de-lis</i>,” says
the monk of St. Denis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1361}</div>

<p>And in December, Jean made his entry into Paris
with a pomp and parade rather unsuitable to the
occasion and the manner of his return, and again
began the usual succession of court festivities and
amusements that formed the occupation of the Valois
princes and those who surrounded them. As to the
peasants, as soon as the peace of Bretigny was signed,
they began to take courage and to work in the fields
again. After a long cold winter the weather seemed
to have cleared up, and they hoped for a good
harvest, though the destruction of most of the barns
and farm buildings had made it difficult to find
places to store it in. The plague, too, was again
increasing, not spreading regularly from south to
north as it had done in 1348, but appearing irregularly
here and there in places which had escaped before,
especially in hilly and mountainous districts where
the inhabitants had hoped they were safe from it. It
attacked first the people who were already weakened
from bad food and other hardships; next those who
had been suffering, as so many were, from agitation,
anxiety or sorrow; and then it began to attack those
who were free from any such disadvantages. It spread
all about, with the same symptoms as before and
attended with the same disastrous consequences.
Every one was, of course, dreadfully afraid of catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
it, so that people shut themselves up, refusing to have
communication with each other; there was no one to
keep order or to do any work, and the great companies
of brigands and disbanded soldiers were all
over the country. There were fifteen thousand of
them near Lyon alone. The King of England sent
orders to those under his allegiance to desist from
their depredations, but they would not obey him.
The plague was very bad all the spring; seventeen
thousand people died of it at Avignon, it was raging
in London and was also at Paris, although not quite
so violent there.</p>

<p>The Queen and her daughter, the Princess of
Burgundy, had died of it in 1360, and now her son
Philippe, the last Capétien Duke, fell a victim to the
same scourge.</p>

<p>On hearing of the death of his stepson, Jean at
once claimed the duchy. As has been already
shown, the heirs male of Duke Robert II. were now
extinct; the Comtesse de Savoie, his eldest daughter,
had no heirs either; of the Duchess de Bar there could
be no question, as she had not only renounced her
claims on her marriage, but was the youngest daughter.
It rested between the King of France, son of the
third daughter, Jeanne, and the King of Navarre,
grandson of the second daughter, Marguérite. To
most people the claim of Charles of Navarre must
appear incontestably the right one; but it is true that
instances in favour of Jean’s pretensions were not
uncommon in these days. At any rate he seized
the duchy, and on the 23rd of December entered
Dijon; took the oath, before the high altar of Saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Bénigne in presence of the chief officials of Burgundy,
to observe the constitution and privileges of that
state; and was careful to rest his claim to the
succession, not on its having lapsed to the crown,
but on the right of his mother, Jeanne de Bourgogne,
speaking much of his grandfather, Duke Robert,
whose heir he declared himself to be and whose laws
and system of government he promised to follow.</p>

<p>The great inheritance of Burgundy was now broken
up, for Artois and the County Palatine went to
Marguérite, Countess dowager of Flanders, second
daughter of Philippe-le-Long, Boulogne and Auvergne
to the next heir of Guillaume XIII., while Flanders
and Hainault remained the inheritance of the child
Marguérite, widow of Philippe de Rouvre.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Four</span> years had passed away: years a little less
unfortunate for France, as although Jean was
still upon the throne and passed his time in travelling
about his kingdom in search of amusement instead of
giving serious attention to the affairs of the State, he
allowed himself to be much influenced by the
Dauphin. He ceased to meddle with the value of
the coinage, he recalled the Jews and forbade private
wars among the nobles. There was still peace
between France and England, although English
subjects were frequently to be found in the ranks
of the Navarrais who were continually at war with
the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
The country was still in a disturbed state, and
infested by troops of brigands who were always
attacking the villages and châteaux. The Seigneur
de Murs, a little castle near Corbeil, was outside his
gates one day, when a party of drovers came up and
complained that his servants had taken some pigs of
theirs. The seigneur invited them to come inside
the gates to see if they could identify any, but no
sooner were they over the drawbridge than they
threw off their disguise, blew a horn, drew their
swords, and being joined by their companions who
rushed out of a wood close by, they seized the
seigneur, his wife and children, and taking possession
of the castle, they made it for some time a centre
from which they pillaged the whole countryside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1364}</div>

<p>By the death of the Queen, Jeanne, Duchesse de
Normandie, was the head of the court and of society.
She was extremely popular, and her beauty the
admiration of every one. Froissart in his chronicles
always speaks of her as “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la belle Duchesse</i>,” or “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la
bonne Duchesse</i>.” And now the time was drawing
near for her to ascend the throne.</p>

<p>The Duc d’Anjou, second son of the King, had
broken his parole and returned to France. Jean,
horrified at such a breach of honour and of the laws
of chivalry, declared his resolution to return to
England. Of the true reasons for this journey,
which was strongly opposed by his ministers and
friends, many different explanations have been given.
Modern historians have in many cases adopted the
well-known story of his reply that if truth and honour
were banished from the earth, they ought still to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
refuge on the lips and in the hearts of kings.
M. Dulaure,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> however, observes that this speech,
which was that of Marcus Aurelius, does not belong
to the fourteenth century, and has been ascribed by
Paradin to François I., and by some other writer to
the Emperor Charles V. And neither the writers of
the “Grandes Chroniques de France,” De Nangis, nor
Froissart, who were the most voluminous chroniclers
of that time, make any mention of it. De Nangis
says that he went to arrange for the ransom of his
third son, the Duc de Berry, and his brother, the Duc
d’Orléans. Froissart declares that he wished to see
the King and Queen of England and to make excuses
for the conduct of his second son. Others have
attributed his persisting in this project to his love
for some English lady, probably the Countess of
Salisbury. M. Paulin Paris, in a note to his edition of
the “Grandes Chroniques de France,” agrees with the
explanation of De Nangis, and treats the idea of the
English love affair as ridiculous and unlikely at
the age of the King of France, who was forty-five.
But this does not seem an unanswerable objection,
considering the character and habits of Jean;
especially if we look at the history of certain other
kings at a much more advanced age&mdash;Henry IV.
for instance.</p>

<p>But whatever might be his reasons, Jean left France
according to the “Grandes Chroniques,” on Tuesday
evening, January 3, 1364, embarking at Boulogne;
and arrived at Dover on Thursday, whence after two
or three days he pursued his way to London, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
met by a great company of illustrious persons and
lavishly entertained by King Edward and the English
royal family, who assigned the Savoy Palace for his
dwelling, where, after about three months passed in
festivities and diversions of various kinds, he was
taken ill and died.</p>

<p>The Dauphin was at Vernon, besieging his step-grandmother,
Blanche de Navarre, when the news
came of his father’s death. Towards her as well as
his eldest sister Jeanne, Queen of Navarre, and his
aunt, Jeanne d’Evreux, Charles was often placed in
an attitude of hostility in which there was no personal
animosity, but which arose from their relationship to
and affection for his arch-enemy, the King of Navarre.
Charles had no wish at all to injure or frighten his
sister, of whom he was very fond, or his aunt, for
whom he had the greatest respect, or his step-grandmother,
who was also his cousin, and with whom he
seems to have been on friendly terms when there was
no particular quarrel going on about Charles of
Navarre. Nevertheless this was not the first time he
had been at open war with these ladies, or engaged
in besieging one of their castles. He hastened to
come to an arrangement with Queen Blanche, and
leaving Bertrand du Guesclin in command of the
troops that were actively opposing the Navarrais, he
hastened to Paris, where the body of the late King
was sent from England. “After the funeral at Saint-Denis,”
says the chronicler, “Charles went out into a
meadow of the cloister of the said church, and there,
leaning against a fig tree in the said meadow, he
received the homage of several peers and barons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
after which he went to dinner, and spent that day and
the next at Saint-Denis. And the following Thursday,
the 9th May, departed the said King Charles to go to
his coronation at Reims, which was to be on the day
of the Trinity following.”</p>

<p>Nothing could be more solemn, stately, and imposing
than the ceremonial used at the coronation of the
Kings and Queens of France; and it must have made
a strong impression upon the religious and cultivated
minds of Charles and Jeanne. By the regulations
made to a great extent by Louis le Jeune in 1179,
and afterwards added to and confirmed by St. Louis,
the King and Queen, on their arrival at Reims, the
city consecrated by the baptism of the first Christian
King of France and the coronation of so many
generations of his successors, were met by a procession
of the canons and other ecclesiastics of the
cathedral, churches, and convents of the town. On
Saturday, the day before the coronation, after complines,
the church was committed to the care of
guards appointed by the King, with those belonging
there. Then the King, in the silence of the night,
came to the church and remained alone in prayer and
watching.</p>

<p>When matins rang, at the dawning of the day, the
King’s guards were marshalled to keep the great
entrance, the other doors being closed. Then matins
were chanted, and after them prime. And then the
King arrived and the coronation began.</p>

<p>On the spot where Clovis was baptised stands the
church of St. Remy, second only to the cathedral in
beauty and grandeur. In it was always kept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
ampoulle of holy oil with which the Kings of France
were anointed, and to which was attached the
ancient legend of its having miraculously appeared,
being brought down from heaven by a white dove at
the baptism of Clovis. This tradition was then firmly
believed, and the ampoulle was brought in solemn
procession by the monks of St. Remy with cross and
candles, carried with great reverence by the Abbot of
that monastery under a silk canopy borne by four of
the brotherhood. The Archbishop of Reims, with the
bishops and canons, came to the door, when the Archbishop
received it from the hand of the Abbot with a
promise to restore it, and carried it to the altar
accompanied by the Abbot and four monks. It was
afterwards taken back to St. Remy.</p>

<p>Two thrones were placed in the middle of the
cathedral, joining the choir. Around the highest,
which was that of the King, were ranged the peers of
France, and all those whose rank and office entitled
them to such places.</p>

<p>The Archbishop girded on his sword, charging him
to keep the army of God, and defend the Church and
kingdom committed to him, with the blessing of God,
by the virtue of the Holy Spirit and the help of Jesus
Christ the invincible Conqueror. Then with prayers
and benediction he was anointed with oil from the
ampoulle, the ring placed on his finger, the sceptre
and hand or rod of justice in his hands, and finally
the Archbishop took the crown from the altar and
placed it on his head, supported by the peers of France
during the prayers and solemn benediction. When
the King was crowned and seated on his throne, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Queen arrived at the cathedral. She prostrated herself
before the altar and was raised from her knees by
the bishops. After some prayers she was anointed,
but with a different oil; a smaller sceptre, and a rod
of justice like the King’s were given to her, and the
ring placed on her finger with these words, “Take
the ring of faith, the sign of the Holy Trinity by
which thou mayest escape all heresy and malice, and
by the virtue given to thee call heathen nations to the
knowledge of the truth.”</p>

<p>And never could the benediction of the Archbishop
have been more fully re-echoed in the hearts of all
around him than when he placed the crown on the
head of Jeanne de Bourbon, saying, “Take the crown
of glory, honour, and felicity, that thou mayest shine
with splendour and be crowned with joy immortal.”</p>

<p>The Queen was conducted to her throne by the
barons who supported the crown, and surrounded by
the ladies of highest rank; after which the King and
Queen kneeling at the altar, received the Communion
from the hands of the Archbishop, who at the conclusion
of Mass took off their crowns and put smaller
ones on their heads, and they proceeded to the
palace with a drawn sword carried before them.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>They left Reims after their coronation, and on the
28th of May, Tuesday, entered Paris. The King
made his entry at one o’clock, went to the church of
Notre Dame and then to the palace, and “about the
hour of nine” the Queen’s procession arrived at the
gate. Her beauty and grace were the admiration of
the multitudes that thronged to see her as she rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
into Paris, the crown on her head, her dress covered
with jewels and the trappings of her horse embroidered
with gold. Philippe, Duc de Touraine, the
King’s favourite brother, walked by her side holding
the bridle of her horse. With her were the Princess
Marie de France, afterwards Duchesse de Bar, the
Duchesse d’Anjou and the Duchesse d’Orléans, by
whose horses walked princes of the blood royal, the
ladies of her court with a brilliant
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> of nobles, chevaliers, and
guards, winding through the
crowded, decorated streets to the
Palais de la Cité.</p>

<p>Just after the King and Queen
had entered Paris there arrived
in triumph from the battlefield
Bertrand du Guesclin. He had
won a victory at Cocherel, and
had brought not only the news
of his success but the famous
Captal de Buch, whom he had
taken prisoner, to greet the King
on the opening of his reign.</p>

<div id="illo_4" class="figright" style="width: 179px;">
  <img src="images/i_072.jpg" width="179" height="350" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FRENCH NOBLE, FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</div></div>

<p>There was a great banquet next
day at the palace, at which the Captal, who was
placed on parole, dined with the King.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> And much
honour was shown to Sir Bertrand du Guesclin.
After dinner there were jousts in the courtyard of
the palace, at which the King of Cyprus and many
of the greatest nobles jousted.</p>

<p>On Friday, the last day of May, the King invested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
his youngest brother, the Duc de Touraine, with the
duchy of Burgundy. It had been promised to him
by his father in remembrance of the day when, as a
mere child, he stood alone by his side in the battle
of Poitiers. He afterwards married the heiress of
Flanders and Hainault.</p>

<p>The Duchess-dowager, mother of Jeanne, lived a
good deal at court, and her brother Louis, Duc de
Bourbon, was a great favourite with the King, who
extended his affection for Jeanne to every one belonging
to her. Louis de Bourbon was one of the best
and noblest characters of his century. When a
hostage in England, he made himself so beloved that
he was allowed to go about wherever he chose, and
even to return to France on parole. His estates were
managed during his absence by his mother.</p>

<p>The youngest sister of the Queen, Marie de
Bourbon, was a nun at Poissy, and for her also both
Jeanne and Charles had much affection.</p>

<p>But a constant source of anxiety and grief to them
all had been the unfortunate marriage of their sister
Blanche, Queen of Spain, who lingered in captivity
in one castle after another in spite of the indignation
and remonstrances of the Spanish people, the French
King, and the royal family her relations. At last
came the news that she had been poisoned by
Pedro el Cruel, and her death excited the horror and
execration of France and Spain against her murderer.
Blanche seems to have passed these years in saintly
resignation to the will of God. Her brother the Duc
de Bourbon and her brother-in-law the King of
France did not suffer her death to remain unavenged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Charles V. declared war upon Pedro, and sent
French troops to Spain commanded by Bertrand du
Guesclin, the Bègue de Vilaine, and other officers,
and after a short time he paid for his crimes with the
loss of his throne and his life.</p>

<p>One cannot help being struck by the extraordinary
discrepancy in the accounts given of the Kings of
France by ancient and modern writers. According
to the former, they all appear to have been models
of every virtue and talent under the sun; while if
one reads the descriptions of some of the latter,
especially of those who are republican in principles,
one finds that, with the exception perhaps of Saint
Louis, no King of France ever had any good qualities
at all but courage, and that, while all the misfortunes
that happened were entirely his fault, any success he
might have in the management of his affairs and the
government of his kingdom was either the result of
accident or was due to somebody else.</p>

<p>Charles V., however, may be said to have done
considerably more to deserve his name “le Sage”
than Jean did to earn that of “le Bon.” In all
respects different from his father and grandfather,
he set himself to try to repair the ruin and distress
in which the kingdom was plunged. He was, as
Sismondi remarks, the first modern King of France.
His effigy on the seals is seated in a chair, not
mounted on horseback. It is characteristic of his
life and habits. His government was the personal
government of an intelligent, prudent, and honest
King, occupied with the internal and external affairs
of the State.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> He found himself surrounded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
dangers and difficulties. The country was so depopulated
by plague and famine that in many parts
the inhabitants were reduced to two-thirds and even
one-third of their numbers in the beginning of the
reign of his grandfather. The neighbouring countries
were involved in civil wars and disturbances, into
which it was difficult for France to escape being
drawn. Italy was full of discord. Spain was divided
between the factions of <em>Pedro el Cruel</em> and his brother,
<em>Enrique de Trastamare</em>, who had risen against that
tyrant to avenge the murders of his mother and
brothers.</p>

<p>Charles found no help in his own family. His
eldest sister was married to his enemy the King of
Navarre, to whom she was devoted. The Duc de
Bar, who had just married Marie, the second sister,
was likely to be more trouble than assistance; the
Visconti had paid his father a large sum of money
for the marriage of Isabelle, but were too far off to
have anything to do with affairs in France. Of his
brothers, the two elder ones had all the faults and
scarcely any of the good qualities of the Valois.
They were arrogant, rapacious, violent and cruel.
The Duke of Burgundy was the best of them.</p>

<p>Charles had always been delicate, and people said
he had been poisoned when he was young by the
King of Navarre. It was one of those absurd accusations
heaped upon Charles of Navarre by his enemies.
He could have had no object in poisoning the
Dauphin, for if he had died the crown would have
passed, not to him, but to the Duc d’Anjou, and there
were plenty of other princes of the house of Valois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
whose claims would have come before his. The Dukes
of Berry and Orléans, the Alençon princes, and even
the Duc de Bourbon, all stood before him in the line
of succession.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> But it is probable that the King
firmly believed that he had been poisoned by his
brother-in-law, and therefore was not likely to regard
him with very friendly feelings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1367}</div>

<p>Jeanne nursed and consoled Charles in his frequent
illnesses, and shared and sympathised with all his
tastes.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Both were devoted to art and literature;
Charles V. was the best educated and most learned
prince of the fourteenth century. Almost the only
existing letter written entirely by the hand of a
Valois King of the direct line is by him. It is
preserved at the Dépôt Central.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Jeanne’s love of
books caused her to interest herself in the writings
and translations of the time; she was also fond of
poetry. Many Greek and Latin authors were now
translated into French, and by the desire of the King
and Queen, Nicolas d’Oresme, Bishop of Lisieux,
made a translation of the whole of the Bible, which
Charles took with him wherever he went, being in
the habit of reading it all through every year. It
was in two volumes.</p>

<p>On the 24th March, 1367, Charles laid the foundation
stone of the new church of the Céléstins. Besides
the church he gave them costly presents, amongst
others a great cross of silver gilt. The Queen
presented an image of the Virgin, also of silver gilt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
The church was finished in 1370, and consecrated
by the Archbishop of Sens. Charles lavished upon
this church the most precious objects of art; chalices,
missals, and ornaments of all descriptions; and
especially magnificent were two chapels entirely hung
with cloth of gold, one being covered with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>,
the other with suns and stars. The benefits and
favours conferred by the King and Queen upon this
convent were so great as to cause them to be considered
as founders of it, and their statues were
accordingly placed on the portal of the church.
They spent 5,000 francs in building a dormitory,
refectory, chapter-house and cloister.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>The hôtel St. Paul, where Charles and Jeanne
afterwards lived, was most conveniently near the
Céléstine convent. The courtiers, following their
example, were always giving presents to this brotherhood.
The King’s secretaries founded a confraternity
in their church, and all belonged to it. The King
exempted this order from all public contributions,
even such as were generally paid by the clergy.
They continued for several generations to enjoy such
great favour and protection from the royal family
that they appear to have rather presumed upon their
privileges, for in time it grew into a byword, and
in speaking of a conceited, arrogant person the
exclamation “Voilà un fier Céléstin” became a
common figure of speech.</p>

<p>The Céléstins, as time went on, became celebrated
for the excellence of their cookery; there were
especially certain omelettes for which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
much distinguished. But this was long after the
time we are now considering.</p>

<p>One of the most fashionable convents for women
was that of Chelles, near Paris. It had been founded
by Clotilde, wife of Clovis I., and much enlarged by
Ste. Bathilde, who dreamed that she saw a ladder
raised before the altar of Our Lady, which touched
Heaven, and by which she mounted in a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> of
angels. In consequence of this, the Abbey of
Chelles bore as arms, a ladder between two <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>,
those orders founded by Kings and Queens of
France having the right to bear the lilies in their arms.
The Abbesses of Chelles bore the greatest names
in France, among them were Giselle, sister of
Charlemagne, one of his daughters and numbers of
widows, sisters, and daughters of kings.</p>

<p>But after a time this rich and distinguished establishment
became also very worldly. Some monks
built a monastery close to it, and the King had a
palace on the other side of its walls. Scandals arose.
The nuns got up late, went out hunting and conducted
themselves much more after the fashion of
the court than the cloister. They were on excellent
terms with the brotherhood of the neighbouring
monastery, who were mostly poor cadets of noble
families. They gave parties and made <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confitures</i> for
these monks; and when Louis le Bègue carried off a
nun of sixteen years old over the wall of his palace,
his example was so much followed by his courtiers
that nearly fifty nuns had eloped in a few months.
The Bishop of Paris and Abbot of St. Victor went
to preach and try to carry out reforms; but on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
way back were attacked in the forest and the Abbot
killed.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> After Robert II. (996) the palace fell into
ruins; but the evil reputation of the sisterhood went
on long after. In 1358 they fled to Paris, but
returned to their convent, which was besieged by the
English. They escaped again with their Abbess, Alix
le Passy, and were afterwards collected and reorganised
by Jehanne la Forêt.</p>

<p>King Jean, who was not by any means a literary
character, had only possessed twenty books, but
Charles delighted in collecting them and arranged
his library in a tower in the Louvre, which was called
La Tour de la Librairie.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> He collected nine hundred
volumes, which in those days, before printing was
used, made a considerable library. The catalogue of
this library was made in 1378 by order of the King,
and still exists.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> It was in three rooms, occupying
three floors of the tower, the windows of which
had iron bars and a trellis of ironwork; with
glass painted. The ceilings were of cypress wood
and the walls panelled with richly carved oak.
Thirty candles and a silver lamp burned all night in
each room so that they might be available for study
night and day.</p>

<p>In a manuscript, “Bibliothèque du Roy,” No.
7609, are found the names of the different instruments
of music of the fourteenth century, among
which can be recognised several that are still in
use. Here are the names of some of the books
contained in the <span class="locked">library:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
“Dit de la Rose.”</p>

<p>“Le Livre de la Mutation de Fortune.”</p>

<p>“Le chemin de long estude” (translated from
the Romance into French).</p>

<p>“La Cité des Dames.”</p>

<p>“Le Livre des trois vertus.”</p>

<p>“Le Livre des faits d’Armes et de Chevalrie divisé
en quatres parties.”</p>

<p>“Le Traité de la Paix.”</p>

<p>“Le Corps de Policie.”</p>

<p>Charles V. and Jeanne possessed many beautiful
books on parchment with exquisite miniatures and
illustrations of the fourteenth century, books of
hours and books of psalms, one of which had
belonged to Saint Louis.</p>

<p>They commissioned Raôul de Presle to translate
the “City of God,” by St. Augustine, and gave him
4,000 francs a year for doing it.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Besides books and manuscripts, they had an immense
collection of magnificent objects of art.
Since the days of Louis, the taste for splendour and
costly decoration had spread in all classes. Every
now and then laws were made to check them, but as
the nobles would not obey them and could not be
forced to do so, they only acted as restraints on the
bourgeoisie. And so the most important of all industrial
arts had come to be that of the goldsmith.</p>

<p>It seems extraordinary, considering the impoverished
condition of the finances and the dreadful state
of affairs in general when they came to the throne,
that the King and Queen should have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
spend the sums they did upon buildings, books,
treasures of art, and all cultivated and intellectual
pursuits. But their wise and good management was
so successful in altering the disastrous state of things
caused by the follies and misfortunes of their predecessors,
that they were able to spend money with
royal magnificence upon the aims and objects they
preferred.</p>

<p>Jeanne was clear-headed and sensible, and the
economy and order she introduced into the royal
household was considered an excellent example.
She sold a quantity of costly plate to help pay the
troops of Du Guesclin in 1369, and so contributed to
the successful result of the war with England; after
which they began to collect again.</p>

<p>But their daily life was surrounded by magnificence,
as may be seen by a list made later on by
order of the King, in which appear all sorts of
precious and costly things. Statuettes of gold and
silver, exquisite carvings in ivory, quantities of gold
dishes, plates, candlesticks, basins, salt-cellars, drinking
cups, knives and spoons; very few forks&mdash;there
were only three at Vincennes, of which one belonged
to the Queen. Jewels and precious stones in profusion,
sets of hangings for rooms&mdash;that is to say
portières; carpets, hangings, canopies, curtains for windows
and beds, some of silk, others cloth of gold or
velvet; one is mentioned as being entirely of cloth of
gold, with a cross of red velvet embroidered with
several coats of arms; another of green with stripes
of gold. Spanish leather, richly embroidered cushions,
costly tents to put over the Queen’s bath, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">espreniers</i>. One of these is described as being made
of white satin, embroidered with roses and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>;
others were blazoned with the arms of France and
Navarre.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Every now and then some curious little
incident seems to give a touch of life and interest to
this old list, such as a little gold barrel and chain
with the arms of Burgundy, which the King always
had with him and which had belonged to his grandmother,
Jeanne de Bourgogne; the gold serpents on
the salt-cellars with their tongues in the salt, which
were supposed to reveal the presence of any poison
that might have been put in; a crown <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à bassinet</i> set
with jewels, probably belonging to King Jean, who
was in the habit of wearing a crown on his helmet in
battle, regardless of the additional danger of proclaiming
his rank; and in the midst of this catalogue
of splendour “item, an old mattress all torn and the
pillow the same, which had belonged to King Jean.”
Two banners of France covered with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>
and bordered with pearls, to drive away the flies
when the King was at table; dog-collars of velvet
and silver, green game bags embroidered with pearls,
inkstands, purses, whips, leather lanterns. The contents
are given of some coffers or boxes the King
always took about with him and of which he kept
the keys. Amongst the rare cameos, jewels, gold
chaplets, &amp;c., was the holy stone to make women have
children, and another stone which cured the gout.</p>

<p>Different things are mentioned as having belonged
to Charlemagne and St. Louis. There were also
gold basins to wash in, and gold vases to put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
remains of repasts to give to the poor. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bas-reliefs</i>
of gold, generally of sacred subjects, and all the
things belonging to the chapels, such as chalices,
crucifixes, missals, crosses, statues, hangings, reliquaries,
paternosters, &amp;c., most costly and beautiful.
An immense number of crowns and coronets seem
to have belonged to the King, Queen, and Princesses,
and jewelled girdles, clasps, and
rings are also enumerated among
their possessions.</p>

<p>Charles and Jeanne at the beginning
of their reign lived chiefly at
the Louvre and at Vincennes, where
he ordered four of the inhabitants
of the village of Montreuil to watch
against poachers every night in the
forest. At Vincennes had been
born on June 7, 1366, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entre tierce et
midi</i>,” another daughter to the King
and Queen. She was christened four
days afterwards in the chapel there
and named Jeanne, her god-parents
being the Duc de Berry, the two
Queens dowager, Jeanne d’Evreux
and Blanche de Navarre, and Marguérite, Countess
of Flanders and Artois. But the same ill-luck
seemed to pursue the children of Charles and
Jeanne as had followed those of Philippe de Valois
and Jeanne de Bourgogne; for this little princess
also died the following December, and was buried
at St. Denis, leaving the King and Queen again
childless.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A French</span> historian assures us that in this, the
year before the war began again, “the presage
of it was seen in the heavens, that is to say in the
Holy Week a comet between north and west with a
long hairy tail stretching towards the east and red
rays like a pyramid of fire.”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>The monks went preaching about in all the French
provinces for the rights of Charles V.; in the English
ones for Edward III.</p>

<p>“In this year the King and Queen sat in parliament
on the vigil of the Ascension,” and Jeanne gave
her advice and opinion, by special desire of the King,
upon the important affairs then discussed. Whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
he was ill the secret despatches were all taken to her,
and her seal carried the same authority as his own.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1368}</div>

<p>He had detached Armand d’Albret from the
English cause and married him to Marguérite, one
of the Queen’s sisters, to the indignation of the
Black Prince, who spoke “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moult rudement</i>” about it.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
As Armand d’Albret had before seized the castle
of La Motte d’Epineul, it was made part of the dowry
of the young princess, who often appears in descriptions
of festivities at her sister’s court.</p>

<p>In 1371 she was godmother, with the Princess
Jeanne, daughter of Philippe VI., to her niece,
Marie de France. Her husband and son were
killed at Azincourt, and, like her sister Bonne,
Comtesse de Savoie, she undertook the guardianship
of her grandson, Charles d’Albret, for whom in
1416 she obtained letters from Charles VI. admitting
him to do homage for his lands though under fifteen
years old.</p>

<p>Hitherto every King of France had held his court
either in the palais de la Cité or the Louvre. Those
who only know the Louvre as the magnificent
Renaissance palace of François I. and Henri II.,
can perhaps hardly picture it as the most romantic
royal castle that ever existed. The buildings formed
an oblong court, with round towers at the angles and
in the middle of the sides, while nearly in the centre
of the court stood a massive round keep, and to the
south and east were well defended gateways. All
this was moated, and on the side towards the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
were other walls and towers.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> It was outside Paris
until Charles included it within the walls. He
altered the internal arrangements, heightening the
rooms and also the towers, so that it was more
beautiful than ever. It was he who built the long
line of towers all along the river. They were
of all sizes and shapes, and each had a captain
of its own. The names of many of them are
known from the registers in the Chambre des
Comptes. The Tour du Fer-de-cheval, Tour de
l’Orgueil, du Bois, de l’Ecluse, Jean de l’Etang, de
l’Armoirie, de la Taillerie, de la grande Chapelle, la
petite Chapelle, Grosse Tour du Louvre, Tour de la
Librairie, and many others. The Grosse Tour, built
by Philippe Auguste, was enormously thick and
strong, and had a dungeon. The great portal was
on the river, flanked with towers; the second
entrance was narrow, with two towers, on which
were sculptured the figures of Charles V. and
Jeanne de Bourbon.</p>

<p>The rooms were large, low, with panels of wood;
the windows narrow, barred with iron and filled with
glass, on which were painted the arms of the person
to whom the apartment belonged&mdash;King, Queen,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enfants de France</i>, princes of the blood, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The apartment of the Queen was below that of the
King, and exactly the same in size and disposition.
Sauval remarks that the view of the river from the
windows was very beautiful. The apartments of the
King, the Queen, and each of their children had a
chapel and gallery attached to it. In the apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
afterwards given to the Dauphin there was a clock,
doubtless made by Jean de Vic, who about that time
made one for the King, which was placed in the
Tour du Palais and has been supposed to be the
only one in Paris under Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The great garden of the Louvre was very old: it
had <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">treilles</i> or trellised walks from one end to the
other, hedges, arbours, and grass. It was planted
with roses and other flowers, herbs and vegetables.
There were two smaller ones, called the King’s and
Queen’s garden.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>The great garden went up to what is now the
Rue St. Honoré, and was bounded by the city walls.
To any one who is fond of flowers and gardening, it
is most interesting to read the old bills and accounts
preserved in different registers, and to see something
of what these ancient gardens were like.</p>

<p>“Compte 1362, of Pierre Culdöë, lieutenant, and
the noble Messire Jean de Damille, chevalier,
chastelain of the castle of the Louvre, of the
receipts, &amp;c., for certain works which have been
done in the gardens of the said Louvre, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la plaisance
du Roy, nostre Seigneur</i>, beginning in the month of
May ‘362,’ and finishing in the month of March
CCCLXIII.”</p>

<p>Then follow many interesting accounts, of which,
however, it is impossible to give more than a few
specimens. For instance, sums of money are paid
<span class="locked">to&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Perin Durant, gardener, for having got many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
good herbs and planted the same in the said gardens
of the Louvre in the month of March, 1362.”</p>

<p>“To Pierre Hubert, trellis-maker, for having
fastened up the hedges round the said gardens in
the month of February, and done up about half the
said hedges which the wind had blown down; for
wood, osier, and trouble.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>“To Jean Baril, for having made a heap of earth
(mound) with a summer-house of trellised wood on the
top, with the arms of the King, Queen and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nos
seigneurs</i> de France upon it, and having made a
drawbridge to it in the month of March, 1362, for
wood, osier, and trouble.”</p>

<p>“To Jean Caillon and Geffroy de Febon, gardeners,
for their trouble in having planted sage, hyssop,
lavender, strawberries, and several other herbs in
the gardens of the said Louvre, for having dug the
garden all round, put in herbs and seeds, renewed
all the paths and grass plots (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">préaux</i>) and taken
away the weeds and rubbish.”</p>

<p>“To Jean Dudoy, gardener, for having ... taken
away all the weeds, stones, and rubbish, and made
several beds of sage, hyssop, lavender, balsam, strawberries,
and violets, and planted bulbs of lilies, double
red rose trees, and many other good herbs which
he got.”</p>

<p>“To Sevestre Vallerin, the work of his arm (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la
peine de bras</i>) for his trouble in having weeded the
paths which go among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">préaux</i> (courts or grass
plots), and the beds in which are the rose trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
strawberries, violets, sage, hyssop, lavender, balsam,
parsley, and other good herbs: and also for having
watered four summer-houses and a great square
room to make the plants grow (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour faire venir les
herbes</i>).”</p>

<p>“To Etienne de la Groye, gardener, for having
made in the said gardens certain trellises, arbours,
and hedges all along the walls, inside.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>We hear of some one being paid also for planting
a pear tree, and lettuce is mentioned amongst the
vegetables that mingled with the flowers growing in
the quaint old garden. It must have been a strange
place, with its stiff beds of roses, lavender, and sweet
herbs, its formal paths and summer-houses, its long
trellised walks under the huge, ancient walls,
shadowed by a forest of frowning towers.</p>

<p>As the Queen’s apartments in the south wing of
the château would not contain all the rooms
required, some more were allotted to her looking
west; and some to the King, who, out of consideration
for the Queen, had given her the first floor and
taken the second for himself. One of these was the
bedroom of the King, and containing amongst other
furniture one of two great beds, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour le corps du
Roy</i>,” furnished by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">courtepointier</i>, Richard des
Ourmes, at the price of twenty francs of gold each.</p>

<p>The King’s cabinet or study (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">estude</i>) was lighted
by one large window with painted glass, and four
small ones, and hung with black <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">drap de Caen</i>. It
had a high chair, a bench, a form (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">escabelle</i>) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
two bureaux. Green drapery was thrown over the
furniture, and a high chimney with mantelpiece of
stone warmed the room, which was most likely
between his oratory and library. His chapel, or
oratory, was vaulted, and heated by a stove in the
winter.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>The furniture in the Louvre consisted of enormous
cupboards, buffets, and heavy chairs or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faudesteuils</i>,
all richly carved, illuminated, and sometimes
decorated with gold and gems; benches, forms,
settles, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dossiers</i> or seats with backs, covered with
velvet, satin, or cloth of gold; an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">estendait</i>, or kind
of sofa is mentioned as being in one or two of the
rooms; the walls were hung with tapestry, and there
were plenty of carpets and cushions, some embroidered
with pearls. Spanish leather was thrown
on the floor in summer.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>The house linen seems to have been kept in chests
in the bedrooms: a number of white silk sheets are
described as being in a square box with two covers
in the large window in the King’s room; and later in
his palace called Beauté, in a gilded chest (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coffre</i>) in
the room where the King slept, there were towels,
tablecloths, and sheets of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">toile de Reims</i>; also richly
embroidered pillows, one of which had on it a knight,
a lady, two fountains and two lions. There were
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couvertoers</i>, or warm coverings for winter, and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couvertures</i>, or sheets of ornamental stuffs thrown
over the beds in the day. One of these is mentioned
as being of ermine, fastened to an old sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marramas</i>, of which the King had caused a breadth
to be cut off to make a chasuble.</p>

<p>The chimneys were of course high and open, with
great fires on dogs (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chenets</i>) on the hearth. There
exist bills for three <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chenets de fer</i> for the Queen’s and
other rooms, and for tongs, shovels, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirtifeux</i>.
Also for bellows, “five new bellows carved and
ornamented with gold.”</p>

<p>There are also bills from one Marie Lallemande,
for blue and white stuff for the window curtains of
the King’s and Queen’s bedchambers, and for
eighteen feather beds with pillows; and from Jean
de Verdelay and Colin de la Baste for six tables of
walnut wood and a pair of trestles for the Queen’s
rooms, and for the King’s large dining-room an oak
bench with columns (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">un banc de chesne à coulombes</i>)
twenty feet long for the King’s larger table, with the
daïs of the same length and three feet wide, and a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dréçoir</i> with a step round it in the same room (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sale</i>),<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">et enfonsé le viez banc Sainct Louis, et une marche
autour</i>.”</p>

<p>The King was anxious to attract to his court
any literary or talented persons that could be
found, and being himself, like every one else of his
day, a believer in astrology, he gladly welcomed a
learned man and celebrated astrologer named Thomas
de Pisan, a native of Bologna, who, delighted at his
reception, sent for his wife and daughter and presented
them at the Louvre, 1368. Charles took the
whole family under his protection. He gave an
income to the astrologer, and his daughter, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
celebrated Christine de Pisan, was brought up at
court as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demoiselle de qualité</i>. Her father, seeing
her talents, bestowed much care on her education.
She was taught Latin and French, and not allowed
to forget her native Italian; she also studied science
and literature. At fifteen she was married to
Etienne du Chastel, a young man of good birth and
education, but small fortune, who was made one of
the King’s secretaries. She became a distinguished
writer, and is best known for her life of Charles V.,
written, after his death, at the command of the Duke
of Burgundy. Her style is exceedingly pompous and
fulsome, but some interesting details can be gained
from her writings, and if they were not crammed with
tiresome, prosy moral sentiments, and absurd flattery
of the King, they might have been much more
interesting and valuable still. After the death of
Charles V., the prosperity of the family waned: her
father lost most of his pay and died old and poor;
her husband died 1402, and one of her sons died
young. Her daughter became a nun at Poissy.</p>

<p>On the 16th of April, 1368, Lionel, Duke of Clarence
second son of the King of England, passed through
Paris on his way to Italy to marry the daughter of
Galeazzo Visconti. The Dukes of Berry and Burgundy
went to meet him at St. Denis and conducted
him to the Louvre, where his room was “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moult bien
parée et aournée</i>.” He dined and supped that day
with the King, and the next day dined with the Queen
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en l’ostel du roy près de Saint-Pol, là où elle estoit lors
logiée et y fist-en très grant feste</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> After dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
when they had played and danced, the Princes
returned to the Louvre, where Lionel stayed during
the few days he was at Paris, being entertained by the
different members of the French royal family. Lionel
of England was a handsome and courageous Flemish
giant, mild-tempered and amiable, possessing no great
vigour of intellect.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Through his daughter married to
Edmund Mortimer the line of York derived their
claim to the English crown.</p>

<p>The King had a painted barge like a floating house,
richly decorated inside and outside, in which he used
to go up and down the Seine from the Louvre to his
new and favourite palace of St. Paul,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> which he had
built chiefly while he was still regent.</p>

<p>Charles and Jeanne had now been married eighteen
years, and had no children. They had never had a
son, and their three daughters had all died, to their
great grief. But on the 3rd of December, 1368, “on the
first day of the Advent of our Lord, at the third hour
after midnight, the Queen Jehanne, wife of King
Charles, then King of France, had her first son in the
ostel near St. Pol; and the moon was in the sign of
the Virgin in the second phase of the said sign, and
the moon was twenty-three days old. For the which
birth the King and all the people in France had great
joy, and not without cause, for until now the said King
had had no male child. And the King gave thanks
to God and the Virgin Mary. And that day he went
to Notre Dame de Paris, and caused a beautiful mass
to Our Lady to be sung before her image at the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
of the choir; and the next day, Monday, he
went to Saint Denis in France on pilgrimage, and he
caused to be given away at Paris a great heap of
florins, to the number of three thousand florins and
more.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>The child was christened on Wednesday, the 6th
of December, and the chronicler thus describes the
<span class="locked">proceedings:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Wednesday following, sixth day of December,
in the year one thousand three hundred and sixty-eight
aforesaid, the said son of the King was christened
in the church of Saint-Pol of Paris, about the
hour of prime, in the manner which follows. And the
day before were made enclosures of wood in the street
before the said church, and also inside the said church
about the font, to take care that there should not be
too great press of people.</p>

<p>“First: before the said child went two hundred
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">varlés</i> who carried two hundred torches, who all
remained in the said street,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> holding the said burning
torches, except twenty-six who went inside. And
after was Messire Hue de Chasteillon, seigneur de
Dampierre, master of the crossbowmen, who carried a
candle in his hand, and the Comte de Tanquarville,
who carried a cup in which was the salt, and had a
towel at his neck with which the said salt was covered.
And after was the Queen, Jehanne d’Evreux, who
carried the said child in her arms, and Monseigneur
Charles, seigneur de Montmorenci, et Monseigneur
Charles, comte de Dampmartin, were beside her; and
thus they issued from the said hostel of the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Saint-Pol, by the door which is the nearest to the
church. And immediately after the said child, were
the Duc d’Orléans, the King’s uncle, the Duc de Berry,
the Duc de Bourbon, the Queen’s brother, and many
other great seigneurs and ladies; Queen Blanche, the
Duchesse d’Orléans, the Comtesse de Harcourt and
the Dame de Lebret,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> sisters of the Queen, who were
well adorned with coronets and jewels.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The chronicler goes on to describe the christening,
the cardinals, bishops, and abbots with mitres and
crosiers, how the crowd was so great that the child
had to be taken home by a back way and how the
King gave away money in the coulture Ste. Katherine,
where there was also such a crowd that several women
were killed.</p>

<p>The Queen seems to have been ill a long time, for
the chronicler says that there was a great fête when
she recovered (<i>releva de sa gésine</i>) from her confinement,
on the 4th February, and after the dinner a
dance and other amusements, and the King gave his
son the title of Dauphin du Viennois.</p>

<p>Charles had succeeded in getting rid of the Grande
Compagnie led by the Archiprêtre, mentioned in the
life of Jeanne de Boulogne, Bertrand du Guesclin
having persuaded them to go with him to Spain, to
fight against Pedro el Cruel, at the request of the
King, who said: “If some one would lead <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ces gens-là</i>
against the miscreant and tyrant Pedro, who has
killed our sister, let him do so whatever it costs
me.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

  <div class="caption">THE BASTILLE.</div></div>

<p>The news of the defeat and death of Pedro was
brought to Paris in the early summer, and the
chronicler remarks, “and certainly many people
thought that this had happened to the said Pierre
because he was a very bad man and had wickedly and
traitorously murdered his good, wedded wife, daughter
of the Duc de Bourbon and sister of the Queen of
France.” The inhabitants of Guyenne had revolted
against the Black Prince, who had been taxing them
too heavily; and the war with England had begun
again, but this time it seemed to be going in favour of
France. Fortress after fortress fell into French hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and on the 29th April, Abbeville surrendered to Hue
de Châtillon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1370}</div>

<p>This and the next year passed prosperously for the
kingdom. Bertrand du Guesclin, created Constable
of France, was everywhere winning back towns,
castles, and fortresses; the gallant Sir John Chandos
was killed in Poitou, and by the end of 1370, Ponthieu,
Périgord, Rouergue, Saintonge, Poitou, part of
Limousin, and nearly all Guyenne had been won
back. The rapid restoration of the kingdom was a
marvel to every one. The hero du Guesclin was the
idol of the nation; the Duc de Bourbon especially
loved him because he had avenged his sister the Queen
of Spain. The wise and firm government of the King
brought prosperity and order into everything. His
Court was magnificent, not with the wild and warlike
revelry of Philippe and Jean de Valois, but with the
refined and artistic luxury of a prince more cultivated
than his time.</p>

<p>All round about Paris he restored and rebuilt the
royal châteaux that had been destroyed by the English
and Navarrais, taking care to fortify them at the
same time. Melun, Creil, Montargis, amongst others,
and St. Germain, which had been burnt by the soldiers
of King Edward. He gave Paris a new bridge, walls,
gates, and the Bastille, of which the first stone was
laid by Aubriot, provost of Paris, in April, 1370. He
had built two new royal residences, Beauté, a most
delightful château at the end of the forest of
Vincennes, and the hôtel de St. Paul at Paris, having
taken a dislike to the Palais de la Cité, from the scenes
of blood and terror that he had witnessed there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
The Louvre was not large enough for the immense
number of suites of apartments he wanted. Gradually
it was used in his reign chiefly to entertain and lodge
foreign princes. He bought several hôtels, gardens,
and meadows and turned the whole into one huge
palace, which, with its pleasure grounds, covered
nearly all the space between the river, the rue St.
Antoine, the rue St. Paul, and the Bastille. The
hôtels de Sens, de Saint Maur, d’Etampes, hôtel de la
Reine, and others.</p>

<p>The whole were surrounded with a high wall, enclosing,
besides all these great hôtels which formed
the palace, and were connected by twelve galleries,
six meadows, eight gardens, and a number of courts.
All the princes of the blood, great nobles and officers
of the court had their apartments in this wonderful
palace, which the King declared should for ever
belong to the Crown, adding that he had there enjoyed
many pleasures, endured and recovered from
many illnesses, and therefore he regarded it with
singular affection.</p>

<p>It was a curious mixture of luxury and simplicity,
arm, feudal castle, and palace all in one.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> The King
delighted in the gardens and orchards and used to
work in them with his own hands. Both he and
Jeanne were also very fond of animals, and seem to
have had an immense number of pets, for which there
were enclosures and aviaries in all their palaces, but
especially at their two favourite abodes, St. Paul and
Beauté. They had lions and wild boars amongst
other creatures, and numbers of birds. Besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
great aviaries at the Palais, the Louvre, St. Paul, and
the other palaces, there were in every apartment in St.
Paul bird-cages of wire painted green, and there is an
account of a large octagon cage made at that palace<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
for the King’s parrot, which is called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la cage au
pape-gaut du Roy</i>.” There were numbers of fowls,
pigeons, and peacocks, the wild boars were kept in a
garden, the lions, of course, in dens, and there were
rooms for the turtle doves and for the Queen’s dogs.</p>

<p>The description of the interior of this palace, or
group of palaces, reads like a page out of the
“Arabian Nights.” One large hôtel (one of three
houses the King gave the Queen) was used for her
horses, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coches</i>, and the grooms and people belonging
to her stables. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conciergerie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lingerie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tapisserie</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pâtisserie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pelleterie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fruiterie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lavandrie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">saucisserie</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">panneterie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">épicerie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">taillerie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maison du four</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeux de
paumes</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garde-manger</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">celliers</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">caves</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cuisines charbonnerie
fauconnerie</i>, &amp;c., must have formed a little
town in themselves. Silk, velvet, tapestry, Spanish
leather, and cloth of gold covered the walls, floors,
and seats. The furniture, massive and picturesque in
form, was ornamented with rich carving, illumination,
gold or gems. The beams of the ceiling were
decorated with gold <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>. The rooms were
heated with stoves (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">étuves</i>) and huge fires on open
hearths, with magnificent chimney pieces of stone
sculptured often with colossal statues and figures of
animals. The washing basins and all the dinner
services, &amp;c., used by the royal family were of gold or
silver. All the numerous apartments of the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
princes, princesses, and great personages had chapels,
galleries, bath-rooms, &amp;c., attached to them. The
room of the King’s jewels was brilliant with gold,
silver, and precious stones.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the art treasures of gold, jewels,
and illuminations, what would not a lover of art and
antiquity in our own day give for one of the long oak
benches, for instance, ending in handles like those of
baskets, carved all over with birds and animals, and
mounted on many carved columns&mdash;especially for the
one called “the old bench of St. Louis,” which stood
in the King’s dining room at the Louvre.</p>

<p>It was in their favourite hôtel de St. Paul, or as it
is called in old writings, St. Pol, that Charles and
Jeanne principally lived, and here were born the
Dauphin and all their younger children.</p>

<p>The birth of the Princess Marie took place on the
27th of February, 1370, and her godmothers were
Jeanne, daughter of Philippe VI. and Queen Blanche,
and the Dame d’Albret, sister of the Queen.</p>

<p>With the exception of Blanche, whom she never
met again after her disastrous marriage with the
King of Spain, Jeanne saw a great deal of her family,
especially of her three youngest sisters, the Comtesse
de Harcourt, the Dame d’Albret, and the Prieure de
Poissy. Bonne, Comtesse de Savoie, was farther
away in her beautiful southern home, and being the
wife of a greater prince, had more of the occupations
and cares of a government upon her hands. Bonne
was brave, clever, sensible, and universally admired.
Things went prosperously enough with her until, after
she had been married about thirty years, in 1385 her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
husband, the Green Count, died of plague in Italy,
where he had gone on some warlike expedition. She
governed Savoy for her son Amadeo VII., the Red
Count, whom she married to a daughter of the Duc
de Berry. But the Red Count was killed out hunting
in 1391. He left the guardianship of his son and the
regency of Savoy to his mother, in whom he might
well have the greatest reliance, instead of to his young
widow who had neither the talents nor experience to
fit her for such a trust, and who, he was quite sure
would marry again, as she did. In spite of her
opposition the Countess Bonne assumed the guardianship
of her grandson Amadeo VIII. and the State.
After he came of age she could not get her dowry
properly paid, so she sent for her brother Louis, Duc
de Bourbon, who came at once with a troop of
soldiers and threatened to make war upon the
Savoyards. Thereupon the dowry was paid without
any further trouble. Bonne died at the Château de
Mâcon, 1402. In 1372 the Duchess-dowager de
Bourbon, mother of the Queen, was at the castle of
Belle Perche, in the Bourbonnais, when one night it
was surprised by three captains of brigands or free
companies, who got in by scaling the walls. Louis
de Bourbon assembled his vassals and friends and
laid siege to the place where his mother was a
prisoner. The Duchess managed to let him know
that she was afraid of the things the engines threw in
and the damage they caused, and that she wished
him to blockade the castle. He did so accordingly,
but the Earls of Cambridge and Pembroke arrived
with a large force and carried off the Duchess and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
ladies to a château in Limousin. She was soon afterwards
exchanged for Simon Burke, a favourite of the
Black Prince. She went to Clermont, a hunting
château of her son, and in the forest close by she met
her daughters coming to see her.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> In a miniature
representing their meeting the Queen advances

holding a bird, the sign of high rank and led by Jean
de Bourbon, Comte de la Marche. Her little
daughter Marie, bearing the same arms accompanies
her, then come the young Duchess, wife of Louis, and
the Queen’s sisters, Comtesses de Savoie and Harcourt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
and Dame d’Albret. Each leads a dog with a
long leash, two ladies follow, one carrying the train
of the Duchesse de Bourbon. All the princesses have
the arms of their husbands and of Bourbon emblazoned
on their dresses, including the Duchess-dowager,
Isabelle de Valois, who also wears a long
widow’s veil.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1373}</div>

<p>Parti-coloured dresses were much worn then. The
Queen’s second son, Louis, was born March, 1371.
Bertrand du Guesclin was his godfather, and put a
sword into his hand, praying God and Our Lady to
make him a good knight. In July, 1373, was born
her daughter Isabelle. The little Dauphin was her
godfather and held her at the font; her grandmother,
the Duchess Isabelle, was her godmother.</p>

<p>Louis de Bourbon had married in 1371 Anne,
daughter of the Comte de Clermont et d’Auvergne.
He was a good soldier, just, generous, and religious;
his court was as magnificent as those of the Dukes of
Burgundy and Orléans. When he returned from
being a hostage in England he instituted an order of
chivalry called the Ecu d’or. During the fête, after
the ceremony, his Procureur-Général, Chavreau, presented
to him a register of depredations committed
on his lands during his captivity by divers lords, his
vassals, most of whom were present, and were seized
with consternation; but the Duke replied, “Chavreau,
have you also the register of the services they have
rendered me?” and without looking at it, threw it
into the fire. It is said that when, after the capture
of his mother, Anne, Duchesse de Bretagne, fell into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
his hands and exclaimed, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, beau cousin!</i> am I a
prisoner?” he replied, “No, madame, we do not make
war on ladies.” His subjects adored him, and when,
many years afterwards, he died and his body was
brought to Moulins to be buried, clergy and people
thronged to accompany it wherever the funeral
passed, with tears and lamentations.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> beds used at this time were enormous. If
only six feet square they were considered very
small and called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couchettes</i>, but when they were from
eight feet and a half by seven and a half to twelve
feet by eleven, they were supposed to be of a
sufficient size and called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couches</i>. These beds were
mounted on very wide steps covered with rich carpets,
and were hung with exquisite and costly stuffs;
alcoves, supposed to be so much later an invention,
were then in use. The chronicler of the quatre
premiers Valois relates that in 1373 the Queen was
seized with a dangerous illness. She seems to have
been delirious, as he goes on to say that she lost her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonne mémoire</i>, that the King, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui moult l’aimoit</i>, made

and good senses. In spite of his delicate health
Charles often made these pilgrimages to holy places,
walking barefoot with the monks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1373}</div>

<p>In the early part of 1373 there were great floods,
especially of the Seine, Marne, Yonne, Oise, and
Loire. They lasted two months and were said to be
the worst that had happened within living memory.
The streets of Paris were full of water so that people
had to go about in boats. From one gate to another
the water flowed; it rose to the bridges and filled the
lower rooms in the houses.</p>

<p>Several princesses of the French royal family had
died within a short time&mdash;the Queen-dowager,
Jeanne d’Evreux, of whose will and funeral an account
was given in a former volume; Jeanne, Queen of
Navarre, eldest sister of the King; the Princess
Jeanne, daughter of Philippe VI. and Queen Blanche,
who died on her way to Spain to marry the son of the
King of Aragon. Also the old Prioress of Poissy,
great aunt of the Queen, who was the Princess Marie
de Clermont, daughter of Robert, Comte de Clermont,
son of St. Louis. In early youth she had been
betrothed to the Marquis de Montferrat. But she
had set her heart on a monastic life, and she took the
veil with the approval of her cousin Philippe le Bel,
in the convent he had just founded at Poissy. She
became Prioress, but having lost her sight she
resigned that dignity, and died in May, 1372, at
seventy-three years of age. It was, of course, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
that Marie de Bourbon, youngest sister of the
Queen, was made Prioress of Poissy.</p>

<p>These were years of success and happiness for
Charles and Jeanne. They had now four children,
two of whom were sons. Prosperity was restored to
their kingdom. The people trusted them, so that
heavier taxes than those which caused riots under
Jean and Charles VI. were paid without opposition
by the subjects of Charles V., who knew that the
affairs of the State were administered by able hands,
and that the money so collected would be used
for the defence and welfare of the country, not
squandered on court pageants or unworthy favourites.</p>

<p>A truce was made with England, who had lost all
the territories won from the late King, and restored
to France by the wisdom of Charles le Sage and the
valour of Bertrand du Guesclin.</p>

<p>Romance and poetry gather, as well they may,
around the career of this heroic leader, the despised,
neglected child of a poor Breton gentleman; who
swept the English from his country, and died
Constable of France, surrounded by his victorious
troops, the keys of Châteauneuf-Randon, his last
conquest, being laid upon his coffin. His father, a
Breton noble, and his mother, who was proud and
beautiful, considered their eldest son a disgrace to
their family&mdash;for Bertrand was ugly, rough, and
continually fighting and getting into mischief.
Disliked and ill-treated at home he made his escape
from his father’s château, and took refuge with an
uncle and aunt, who received him with kindness, and
with whom he remained. When he was sixteen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
seventeen there was one day a wrestling match at
Rennes, and being resolved to attend it he ran away
from church, fought at the match and won the prize,
but was so dreadfully hurt that he had to be carried
back to the château of his uncle, where he was laid
up for some time, during which his aunt, divided
between her sorrow and uneasiness about his wounds
and her anger at his disobedience, kept coming into
his room, alternately reproaching and consoling him.
Sometime afterwards there was a tourney at Rennes.
Bertrand borrowed a horse and arms of his cousin
and presented himself in the lists, challenging the
first esquire who would break a lance with him.
One of the bravest of the troop came forward, and
was overthrown by him at the first shock. The next
adversary who advanced was his own father. Recognising
the arms of his house upon his father’s shield,
Bertrand threw down his own, to the astonishment of
all present, who attributed his doing so to fear. But
he overthrew the next adversary and then raised his
casque. His father embraced him, and his mother
and aunt were filled with joy. His father then gave
him everything he wanted for the outfit of a cavalier,
and by his gallant deeds he soon rose to the height
of fame. The story of his death in 1380, when
besieging the castle of Châteauneuf-Randon in
Gévaudan, as told by ancient chroniclers, is as
follows: The Castle was to surrender the day after
Du Guesclin died; Marshal de Sancerre summoned
the Governor to give up the keys, but he answered
that he had sworn to yield them only to Du Guesclin.
Being told that he was dead, he replied, “Then I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
lay them on his tomb.” The Marshal consented, the
Governor, at the head of the garrison, issued from the
castle, and passing through the ranks of the besieging
army knelt before<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> the body of Du Guesclin and laid
the keys on his coffin.</p>

<p>Before he died Du Guesclin charged his captains
to remember that in whatever country they made
war, women, children, the poor and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">les gens de l’église</i>
were not their enemies. He had all his life been
good to the weak and the poor.</p>

<p>The King and Queen showed all honour and
affection to Du Guesclin.</p>

<p>Louis de Harcourt had been one of the foremost
captains in the English war, and now came to Paris
with the King’s brothers. Charles had suspected
him sometime before of being in love with the Queen,
and had regarded him with jealousy and anger in
consequence, but having become convinced that he
had been mistaken and unreasonable, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">que sans raison
il avoit eu cette folle suspicion</i>, he received him <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moult
agréablement et joyeusement</i>.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>While there can be no doubt that the court of
Charles V. and Jeanne de Bourbon was much more
orderly and more intellectual than those of the two
first Valois kings, it does not seem so certain that it
was equally amusing. It was stately and magnificent;
comfort, luxury, and civilisation had greatly
increased; there were splendid banquets, balls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
other entertainments, but the accounts of the daily
life there, which have come down to us from that
time, especially those of Christine de Pisan, who
lived among the scenes she describes, show a very
different state of things from the brilliant, reckless
lives of pleasure and gaiety led by all who belonged
to the Court of France in the days of Philippe de
Valois and his son Jean.</p>

<p>The King got up at six or seven o’clock in the
morning, and when dressed his breviary was brought
him and he went to his oratory to hear mass; after
which he gave audience to anybody who wished to
ask him anything. In these interviews he treated
everybody who approached him with the greatest
courtesy and kindness. On certain days he then
went to the Council Chamber, and at ten o’clock he
sat down to dinner, music going on all the time of
that repast. When it was over he devoted two hours
to interviews with foreign envoys, or with any one
bringing news from the seat of war,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> or of any other
matters of importance in different parts of his kingdom.
Then he went to lie down for an hour, and
after that, one reads with a feeling of relief, that he
allowed himself a little pleasure. Christine de Pisan
takes care to explain that this was only in order that
he might work better afterwards, but one may trust
that this absurd suggestion was only an idea of her
own, and that the mind of Charles was not so
saturated with duty and dulness as she would imply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
At any rate, he amused himself during this part of
the day by looking at his books, jewels, and different
collections, and talking with his friends. Perhaps the
most intimate and the one he loved best was Jean de
la Rivière. There is a note of a ring he gave him,
with a ruby in it <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui tient au violet</i>.</p>

<p>Next, the King went to vespers and then out into
his garden, where generally the Queen was with him,
and where curious and beautiful things were often
brought to them by the merchants. In winter he had
different books read to him; stories from the Scriptures,
philosophy, romances, &amp;c., till supper, and
during the rest of the evening he amused himself.
Jeanne also had some one to read aloud to her while
she was at dinner.</p>

<p>The King’s devotion to the Queen had never
changed. From his boyish days at the court of his
grandfather she had been the only woman he had
ever loved. Without consulting her he would take
no step of importance, and he cared for no pleasure
she could not share. They lived, as Christine de
Pisan says, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en paix et en amour</i>. Charles delighted
in finding and giving her beautiful presents of jewels,
curiosities, objects of art, or anything that he thought
would please her.</p>

<p>Christine de Pisan describes with enthusiasm the
way in which Jeanne held her court, the order and
magnificence with which everything was arranged,
whether in the daily life of her court and household,
or in the splendid entertainments and ceremonies of
state. She speaks of the beauty and dignity of
Jeanne, as she appeared at these festivities, wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
her crown, her royal mantle of cloth of gold, or of
silk covered with precious stones, and a girdle of
jewels, accompanied by two or three queens (the two
Queens-dowager, Jeanne and Blanche, and the Queen
of Navarre), by her mother the Duchesse de Bourbon
and by all the members of the royal family and
court.</p>

<p>The peers of France in the time of Charles V. were
as follows: Original peers ecclesiastical, called Clercs
Ducs, <i>i.e.</i>, the Archbishop of Reims and the Bishops
of Laon and Langres; Clercs Comtes, <i>i.e.</i>, the Bishops
of Beauvais, Châlons, and Noyon.</p>

<p>Lay peers, <i>i.e.</i>, Dukes of Burgundy, Normandy, and
Aquitaine; Counts of Toulouse, Flanders, and Champagne.</p>

<p>But the King held in his hands the Counties of
Toulouse and Champagne, and the following new
ones had been created.</p>

<p>Comte d’Alençon, Duc de Bourbon, Comte
d’Etampes, Comte d’Artois, Duc de Bretagne, Comte
de Clermont and Roi de Navarre (as Comte
d’Evreux).</p>

<p>The lay peers sat on the right of the King, the
ecclesiastical on the left. New peers sat according to
creation.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>That Charles should forbid private wars among the
nobles was a matter of course. He also made a law
forbidding games of hazard. He discouraged all
books of licentious tendency and conversation of the
same kind, and gave out that those who led scandalous
lives would lose his favour and be dismissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
from court. He was very angry with a young
chevalier who had, as Christine de Pisan expresses it,
“instructed the Dauphin in love and folly,” and forbade
him to enter his presence, or that of the Queen and
their children; but he does not seem to have been
cruel or very severe. He would by no means allow
either his nobles or any one else to condemn their wives
to perpetual imprisonment if they were unfaithful to
them, “considering the fragility of human nature,” and
was with great difficulty persuaded to allow of their
being kept under restraint if their conduct was too
outrageous.</p>

<p>On one occasion his barber, who was shaving him,
kept putting his hand in the pouch or purse the King
wore at his side and taking out money. Charles saw
what he was about and forgave him; but he repeated
his offence twice or thrice. The fourth time, the King
dismissed him but would not allow him to be put to
death, as by the laws of that time he was liable to be;
because he had served him so long. Another time,
“it was in the time of the pestilence, before he was
crowned,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> as he was entering Paris with a great company,
after a great commotion in the town which had
been against him,” as he passed through a street one
of the rabble cried out, “By God, Sire! if I had been
believed, you would not have come in; but they will
not do much for you.”</p>

<p>The Comte de Tanquarville, who rode before the
King, wanted to go and put the fellow to death, but
Charles restrained him, only answering with an indifferent
smile. “They will not believe you, beau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
sire.” On being told by some of the princes that he
was too easy and too ready to grant pardons, by
which he encouraged crime, he replied that he would
much rather be too indulgent than too severe. He
was exceedingly charitable both to the convents and
to the poor and unfortunate of all classes, and gave
away an immense amount of money.</p>

<p>The government of Languedoc had been entrusted
by the King to the Duc d’Anjou, the eldest and
perhaps the worst of his brothers. But his rule was
so cruel and oppressive, and such commotions arose
from it that Charles interfered; forbade the executions
and punishments ordered by the Duke to be
carried out, and took the government of the province
away from him. The two elder of the King’s brothers
were a continual source of uneasiness to him. Believing
from his delicate health that his own life
would not be a long one, he felt a dread that was
only too well founded of what would happen if in the
event of his death the kingdom and the Dauphin
should fall into their hands. He did what he could
to obviate this contingency. He fixed the majority
of the Dauphin at fourteen years of age. He gave
the guardianship of him and his brother and sisters
to the Queen, her brother the Duc de Bourbon, and
his third brother the Duc de Bourgogne. The Duc
d’Anjou, though he was to be regent, was to swear
on the gospels and holy relics to govern loyally for
the welfare of the kingdom and his nephew, and was
to have no jurisdiction over the town and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vicomté</i> of
Paris, the towns and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">baillages</i> of Melun and Sens, and
the whole of the duchy of Normandy, which were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
be administered for the King by his guardians and a
council; he also regulated the fortunes of his younger
children. The Princess Marie was betrothed to
Guillaume de Bavière, Comte de Hollande, et de
Hainault, eldest son of the Duke of Bavaria, and the
Princess Isabelle to Jean, Duc d’Alençon. The
crowns or coronets for these little princesses and
several other of their possessions appear in a list
made by order of their father.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1377}</div>

<p>In December, 1377, the Emperor Charles IV. came
on a visit to the King and Queen. Preparations for
his reception were made on the grandest scale. He
arrived at Cambrai on Tuesday before Christmas
with his son, the King of the Romans, was met by
a body of nobles and cavaliers sent by the King to
welcome him and entertained by the Bishop. The
next night he slept at the abbey of Mont St. Martin.
The Duc de Bourbon, the Comte d’Eu, cousin of
the King, and the Bishops of Beauvais and Paris
came to meet him at Compiègne with three hundred
cavaliers in blue and white, the Duke’s colours. The
Duc de Bourbon entertained the whole company at
supper and the next day, at Senlis, the Emperor was
met by another array of cavalry with the Dukes of
Burgundy and Berry. As he had been seized on the
way with an attack of gout, the King of France sent
a litter drawn by mules and “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblement appareilliée</i>”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
belonging to the Queen, which the Emperor received
with great satisfaction and in which he travelled to
St. Denis. There he was met by a train of prelates
and dignitaries who accompanied him to the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
church, into which, as he was not well enough to walk,
he caused himself to be carried and offered his prayers
before the altar of St. Louis. He was then carried to
his room and his suite were supplied by the Abbot
with “great fish, beef, mutton, rabbits, fowls, fodder
for their horses, and abundance of wine.” Many
presents were brought by the people of the town, and
the Emperor when he had rested was carried to the
treasury of the abbey, where priceless collections of
relics, crowns, and gems were displayed before him.
The robes, crowns, jewels, and everything of the kind
used at the coronations were kept by the Abbot and
monks of St. Denis.</p>

<p>The Emperor spent that day in the Abbey, and
rose very early the next morning, January 4th, as on
that day he was to go to Paris. But before he set off
he was carried again into the church, where he asked
to see the tombs of the kings, especially of Jean and of
Philippe de Valois and his wife, Jeanne de Bourgogne.
For he was the son of the gallant King of Bohemia,
who died at Crécy; his sister, Bonne, was the first
wife of Jean, and he himself had been brought up in
the court of Philippe de Valois and Jeanne de
Bourgogne. As he remarked, “his youth had been
nourished in their hostel and much good they had
done to him.”<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> And he called the Abbot and monks
and begged them to pray to God for the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bons
seigneurs et dames qui gisoient là</i>.” Then, with much
state and ceremony, he began his journey to Paris, to
visit once more the splendid scenes of those far-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
days and the children of those, who had been the
friends and companions of his youth. And he said
that more than any creature on earth he desired to
see the King and Queen and their children, and then
let God take him, for he would willingly die.</p>

<p>The Emperor got out of his litter and entered
Paris mounted on a black horse richly caparisoned
with the arms of France, sent him by the King his
nephew, who came out to meet him mounted on a
tall white charger wearing a scarlet robe, mantle and
hat covered with pearls, with a great train of nobles
and chevaliers gorgeously dressed attended by their
followers wearing their liveries, the officers of the
households of the King and the Dauphin in immense
numbers dressed according to their grades. The
King had sent a proclamation the day before that
no one should dare (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">que nul ne fust tant hardi</i>) to
take up the space in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grant rue</i> by coming to the
palace with carts or people, and no one should move
from the places where they had put themselves to see
the King and Emperor pass. None were allowed
to come into the town, and many of the inhabitants
had to stay outside in the fields, while sergeants-at-arms
were posted in the streets, and thirty of them
with swords and maces rode before the King’s bodyguard.
The King of France, the Emperor and the
King of the Romans rode into Paris side by side in
this magnificent procession, and it was three o’clock
when they arrived at the marble steps of the palace,
when the Emperor, who could hardly hold himself
up from the gout, was placed in a chair covered
with cloth of gold and with much honour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
ceremony conducted to the apartment prepared for
him.</p>

<p>It would be too long in a work like this to give
the details so minutely described and so interesting
to the student of history, of the proceedings of the
next few days, during which the Emperor remained
the guest of the King of France, of the banquets with
five dais one above another in great halls where
windows, ceiling, and columns were hung with cloth
of gold, of the profusion of the feasting, of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">spectacle</i>
of the conquest of Jerusalem in the vast hall of the
Palais de la Cité, of the entertainments at the Louvre,
Beauté and Vincennes, offered by the King to the
Emperor. It will be sufficient to relate what is
perhaps the most interesting event of his sojourn
in Paris, his visit to the Queen at the hôtel St. Paul
on Sunday, January 10th. The Emperor, accompanied
by the King of France, went down to the
quay near the Louvre, where they embarked on the
King’s barge and proceeded by water to St. Pol,
where they landed. They were met in the middle
of the court by the Dauphin and his brother Louis
Comte de Valois, who knelt before the King and
then went to salute the Emperor. The latter took
off his hat, kissed the two boys, and was carried on
in his chair through such a throng of seigneurs,
knights, and people of the Court that the chair
could hardly pass, to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> of the Queen, who
was in the midst of a great assemblage of princesses
and ladies of the court. As he sat by the Queen
the Emperor kept asking for her mother, the Duchesse
de Bourbon, Isabelle de Valois, the sister of his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
wife and friend of his sister Bonne, Duchesse de
Normandie, whom he had known so well in the old
days at Paris and Vincennes. She had withdrawn to
the end of the great room out of the crowd, but when
she was told that he was anxious to see her she came
up to him.</p>

<p>Then for a moment they looked at each other in
silence. The memories of bygone days, of their own
youth, of the forms and faces of the dead came back
to them and they both burst into tears, so that, as
the chronicler says, “it was a piteous thing to see.”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
Finding it impossible to carry on any conversation
then, they deferred it till after dinner. After the
Emperor had rested in the apartment of the Dauphin,
which had been prepared for him, the Kings of France
and of the Romans dined, wine and dessert were
served, and the banquet was in the great Salle de
Sens. Then Charles V. retired to his own rooms;
his brothers with the King of the Romans, who
wanted to see the lions, went to find Louis, Comte
de Valois, who probably wished to go with them, and
the Duchesse de Bourbon came to the apartment of
the Emperor, her brother-in-law. For a long time
they sat together, talking of old times, as people
will who were companions in childhood after being
separated for half a lifetime. Later on they were
joined by the Queen and her two little sons, and they
all stayed with the Emperor till the hour of vespers.</p>

<p>They brought him two beautiful dogs with the
golden <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i> on their silken collars, and he
gave the Queen a gold reliquary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Towards evening the King came to fetch the
Emperor as they were going down to Vincennes
and Beauté, whence the latter was to take his
departure.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1378}</div>

<p>It was the last fête of the court of Jeanne de
Bourbon. For less than a month afterwards, on the
4th of February, at the hôtel St. Paul, she gave birth
to a daughter, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dont moult fut grevée de travail</i>.” To
allay the violence of the fever with which she was
seized the Queen insisted on being put into a cold
bath, after which she became alarmingly ill. The
child was hastily baptized by the Bishop of Paris and
called after her mother’s favourite Saint Catherine.
All her life Jeanne had desired to die before her
husband, and said she hoped she would never live to
be regent. She had her wish,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> for she died in the
King’s arms February 6, 1378, about two hours before
midnight.</p>

<p>The little Princess Isabelle died a few days after
her mother, and was buried by her side at St. Denis.</p>

<p>Jeanne de Bourbon was one of the most charming
and spotless characters in history. From her
childish marriage to her death she does not
seem to have had an enemy or a word of blame
ever attached to her. She was always spoken of as
“la belle duchesse” or “la bonne reine.” Charles
was inconsolable. He never had the frank, open
nature nor the graceful charm of manner that made
some of the princes of his house adored by their
friends and subjects. Quiet and reserved, he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
man of few but deep and lasting friendships and
affections, and he was capable of a deathless love.
The loss of Jeanne broke his heart. From that day
his life was over. He never regained either health or
spirits, but died rather more than two years after at
his château of Beauté at the edge of his beloved
forest.</p>

<p>Isabelle de Valois, Duchess-dowager de Bourbon,
took charge of her granddaughters and retired into
the convent of the Cordelières at Paris, where she
ended her days.</p>

Much better. I know several good women, but

<div class="sidenote">{1375}</div>

<p>It might appear as if some idea of the kind pervaded
this and a former volume, in which, with the
exception perhaps of Charles V. and Louis XII.,
none of the Kings of France treated of can be
exactly so described; whereas the talents, beauty,
and goodness of the Queens seem generally made
evident. But all the researches into the history of
their times, from which these records are drawn, seem
to prove that during the eight reigns in question most
of the Queens of France really were distinguished for
their excellent qualities, and that except the unlucky
Charlotte de Savoie they were all more or less good-looking;
Blanche de Navarre, Isabeau de Bavière,
and Marie d’Anjou being remarkably beautiful; and
that at any rate Blanche de Navarre, the three
Jeannes, wives of Philippe de Valois, Jean and
Charles V., and Anne de Bretagne, were highly
cultivated women, possessing superior talents and
strongly-marked characters. In Isabeau de Bavière
we find an entirely different personality.</p>

<p>Stephan I., Duke of Bavaria, of the ancient house
of Wittelsbach, died in 1375, leaving three sons,
between whom he divided his dominions, and from
whom descend the three lines of Ingolstadt, Landshut,
and Munich.</p>

<p>The strongest ties of affection and friendship
united these three brothers, who however, seem to
have borne little resemblance to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1383}</div>

<p>Stephan of Ingolstadt was short in stature, but
good-looking, high-spirited, and full of romance, his
chief delight being in love-making and warlike
adventures. Friederich of Landshut, a brave, wise,
able prince, was by far the most capable member
of the family, while Johann, a rough and fearless
sportsman, led a wild, jovial life in his own court
and castles, which he filled with huntsmen, hawks,
dogs, and horses.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> From him descends the Munich
line of Bavarian princes.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Johann took a German
wife, but Stephan and Friederich married Taddea
and Maddalena, daughters of Bernabo Visconti, one
of the chiefs of that family so renowned for splendour,
power, and cruelty, then ruling in Milan. After a few
years Taddea died, and left Stephan with a son and
daughter named Ludwig and Isabeau, or Elizabeth.
The latter was born at Ingolstadt 1370 or 1371.
By his second marriage he had no children.</p>

<p>In all Germany, and perhaps in all Europe, there
is not a more beautiful country than Bavaria, with
its lakes, mountains, forests, and ancient castles.
Here Isabeau spent her short childhood, idolized by
her father and brother, flattered and spoiled by all
around her, for her extraordinary beauty was the
admiration of the court. It was a brief childhood,
for she was only about twelve years old when the
first negotiations for her marriage with the King of
France were begun. Her uncle, Friederich of Landshut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
was serving in Flanders with the French against
the English army in the year 1383, just at the
time when the uncles and guardians of the young
Charles VI. were looking for a wife for him, and
as his father, the late King Charles V., had desired
that he should be married to a German, and thus
secure an ally to France against England, they were
hesitating between the daughters of Austria, Lorraine,
and one or two others that had been suggested, and
inquired of Duke Friederich whether there were any
marriageable princess of his family who would be
suitable.</p>

<p>Friederich was naturally anxious not to let slip the
chance of the crown of France for one of his house;
so he explained that, although he had no children of
the right age, his brother, Stephan, had a daughter in
all respects suitable, being extremely beautiful and
about two years younger than the King, and he
lost no time in writing to inform his brother of the
splendid prospect which seemed to be opening before
them. But Duke Stephan, less ambitious than his
brother, was in no way elated by this proposal. He
replied that, in the first place, he did not like unequal
alliances, and between himself and the King of
France the difference was too great; neither did
he wish his daughter to go so far away, but would
prefer to marry her to some noble of his own
country; besides which objections, there existed a
custom that a prospective Queen of France should,
like candidates for the army in our own days, pass a
sort of medical examination which was conducted by
certain matrons chosen from among the ladies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
highest rank at the French court; and to this the
Duke refused to consent. He declared that he was
not going to allow either himself or his daughter to
be made ridiculous by sending her to France on an
uncertainty, or to risk the affront of her being rejected.
She should stay in her own country and marry some
one nearer home. So, for the time, the negotiations
were broken off.</p>

<p>It was indeed most unfortunate that the very
sensible decision of Stephan was not adhered to,
and also that in the one and only case in which the
Dukes of Berry and Burgundy carried out the directions
of the late King, their brother, the result should
have been so deplorable. In all other respects they
disobeyed his injunctions. They brought up his sons
in opposition to his wishes, they wasted the treasure
he had taken so much time and care to collect, they
impoverished the people by their extortions, and
incensed them by their misgovernment, so that they
were fast bringing France back to that state of
anarchy and misery from which she had been
rescued by the wise rule of Charles V.</p>

<p>If Isabeau had stayed, as her father wished, at his
comparatively simple court and married some German
noble, it would probably have been much better both
for France and herself; but this was not to be, for
the rest of the family and connections of that young
princess strongly disapproved of the decision of Duke
Stephan, and used all their endeavours to prevail
upon him to alter it. For many generations the
numerous members of the house of Wittelsbach had
married into all the royal and ruling families of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
France, Burgundy, and Flanders. Amongst others,
the Duchesse de Brabant was a relation of theirs
and was most anxious for the marriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1385}</div>

<p>In 1385, the wedding of a Bavarian prince with one
of the daughters of Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, was
to be celebrated with great pomp and rejoicings at
Cambrai, in the presence of the King and the whole
of the French court. During the festivities the
Duchesse de Brabant took the opportunity of reopening
the subject with the King’s uncles to whom
she pointed out all the alliances and advantages it
would bring. The princes were willing to agree to
it; for they had not yet decided on a wife for their
nephew. A daughter of Lancaster had been suggested,
but this was not approved of, and they were
still hesitating between an Austrian archduchess
and a princess of Lorraine, having, as they said,
received<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> no further communications from Bavaria.
The duchess promised to see about it before the end
of the summer. The Duke of Burgundy, himself
closely connected with the house of Bavaria, was the
chief supporter of this alliance and entered warmly into
the plans of the Duchesse de Brabant, who succeeded
in overcoming the objections of Stephan and persuaded
him to allow his daughter to pay a visit to her and to
the Duchesse de Hainault, also a relation, and then to
go with them to the fair of Amiens, where she would
meet the King. Her uncle, Duke Friederich was to
take her, and in order to avoid anything compromising
to her dignity, she was to go on the pretext of a
pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jean d’Amiens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
where a famous relic was exhibited during the time
this fair was going on. A painter was sent to paint
the portraits of the three princesses, <i>i.e.</i>, of Lorraine,
Austria, and Bavaria. The portraits were shown to
the King, who at once chose that of Isabeau. It still
hangs in the gallery of the Louvre. She wears a red
robe trimmed with fur, a tight corsage partly of blue
velvet and a high headdress ornamented with gold
and jewels.</p>

<p>It was early summer when Isabeau took leave of
her father and her country, and set off with her uncle
upon her journey. They travelled first to Brussels,
where they were warmly received by the Duchesse
de Brabant with whom they stayed three days, and
then went to Quesnoy to stay three weeks with the
Duchesse de Hainault; of whom Froissart remarks,
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La duchesse qui fut moult sage, endoctrinait tous les
jours, en toutes manières et contenances, la jeune fille de
Bavière, quoique, de sa nature, celle-ci estoit propre et
pourvue de sens et de doctrine; mais point de françois
elle ne sçavoit</i>.”</p>

<p>They also made considerable changes in Isabeau’s
dress, which they declared to be far too simple for
the future Queen of France. The Duchesse de
Brabant ordered an entirely new trousseau for her so
that she might be dressed as magnificently as if she
had been her own daughter, and having arranged all
this she went to Amiens, where she was joined by
Isabeau under the care of the Duchesse de Hainault
and her uncle, Friederich of Landshut.</p>

<p>The fair of Amiens, which took place every year
was one of those mixtures of amusement and devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
so characteristic of the Middle Ages. The relic, which
they declared to be the head of St. John the Baptist,
had been brought from the siege of Constantinople
by the Crusaders in 1204; and given by a gentleman
of Picardy to the church of St. Jean d’Amiens, of
which one of his brothers was a canon. It was always
shown at the time of the fair, to which all classes
came in crowds. One can form no idea of the
splendour and picturesqueness of these mediæval
fairs from the squalid spectacles that survive in our
own days.</p>

<p>For what do we see now? Uninteresting but
harmless crowds, mostly clad in cheap, tasteless
imitations of the dress of a higher rank, pressing
into shows which one cannot imagine anybody
wishing to see, surrounding long rows of monotonous
booths filled with ugly, commonplace goods that
one cannot imagine anybody wishing to buy, committing
no crimes and molesting nobody. But although
very few modern fairs in civilised Europe offer anything
worth buying or seeing, they were widely
different in the Middle Ages. In many towns important
fairs took place every year to which people went
properly attended and protected, and where beautiful
and valuable things of all kinds were to be sold.
There the merchants brought jewels, embroideries,
and costly stuffs from Italy and the East; pictures,
illuminated missals, stamped leather, rich carvings
in wood and ivory; delicately wrought cups, flagons,
bowls, and other precious works of the gold and silver
smiths; weapons of war, objects of art, and curiosities
of every description. All sorts of shows and diversions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
were also going on all day and far into the night,
which was the time the King and court usually went.
It was a wonderful sight: the fitful glare of torches
thrown here and there on the booths loaded with
costly wares, while mingling in the throng around
might be seen gleaming armour, magnificent dresses
of silk and velvet, leather jerkins, tall caps, and
peasants’ coarse woollen gowns and tunics; dark
gabled houses forming a shadowy background. Now
and then a fierce quarrel would arise, and there would
be a rush and scuffle of armed men, the glitter of
swords and daggers, shouts, cries, the fall of some and
the dash of others down the dark, narrow streets
which afforded their best chance of escape. The
most famous of the old French fairs were the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Foire
de Lendit</i>, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Landit</i>, held between Paris and St.
Denis, and perhaps the most ancient of all,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> the fairs
of St. Denis and St. Germain, which belonged to the
Abbot and monks of St. Germain-des-Près, and was
held in the celebrated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pré-aux-clercs</i>, a great meadow
or open space going from the Abbey to the Seine.
The fair of Amiens was a great resort of all classes at
that time, and when Isabeau with her uncle, Duke
Friederich, and the Duchesse de Brabant arrived at
its gates the town was thronged with people. The
King was there with his court and a great array of
nobles and ladies, besides numbers of ecclesiastics,
merchants bringing their goods on long trains of
mules, bourgeois and peasants, wandering minstrels
and soldiers, so that the whole place was a scene of
bustle, excitement, and festivity, which may well have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
delighted a young girl scarcely out of childhood
longing for all the pleasure and magnificence so soon
to be laid at her feet. For the King, ever since his
uncles had shown him the portrait of Isabeau had
not ceased to torment them to let him see the original,
and as soon as he heard that she was really close at
hand he sent two of his favourite chevaliers, the
Seigneurs de la Rivière and de la Tremoille, to receive
and conduct her with her relations and suite to the
lodgings prepared for them, and assure them of his
eagerness for the interview which had been arranged
to take place on the following day.</p>

<p>The Duchesses and Isabeau were delighted at
all they heard from the two chevaliers of the King’s
anxiety and impatience, which promised well for the
success of the plan; the beauty of Isabeau being
far too striking to leave much doubt of the effect
it would produce on a romantic, impressionable lad,
who had already fallen in love with her picture.</p>

<p>The next day, Friday, the young princess was
magnificently dressed, the Duchesses of Burgundy,
Brabant, and Hainault, presiding at her toilette,
after which she went with them to the King’s
reception.</p>

<p>Charles, who had lain awake all night thinking
about her, turned eagerly towards the door as Isabeau
entered, and all eyes were fixed on her with interest
and curiosity as she passed through the throng of
courtiers. It must have been a trying moment for
her, though if she felt nervous she did not show it,
but only stood in silence before the King, who hastily
prevented her, as she was about to bow or kneel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
before him, and raised her up with passionate admiration.
All the evening he could not take his eyes
from her, and after she had left and the reception
was over no one felt any doubt of the result. The
Duke of Burgundy told La Rivière, who was going
with the King to his room, to find out while he was
undressing what he wished to be done. Charles
replied: “Tell my uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, to
make haste and conclude
the affair.”<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy
therefore went to the lodgings
of the Duchesse de
Brabant and Princess Isabeau,
and the arrangements
were concluded. The Duke,
at the council, wished the
wedding to be at Arras, but
the King declared he would
not have any more delay, as
he could neither sleep nor
rest. He sent the Princess
a splendid crown, and the wedding was celebrated
at the cathedral of Amiens a few days afterwards,
in presence of the whole court, and followed by
banquets and various festivities, which lasted for
some days. The wedding was so hurried on that
there was no time to finish the trousseau ordered
for the young queen.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> And thus were two spoilt,
self-willed children of fourteen and sixteen placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
at the head of what, in those days, was the most
powerful kingdom in Christendom.</p>

<p>Many people who have a slight acquaintance with
French history picture to themselves Charles VI. as the
miserable invalid he became in later years, and know
nothing about the tall, handsome young Prince, high-spirited,
passionate, generous, and as eager for glory,
as fond of pleasure, magnificence, and love-making,
as his great-grandfather and grandfather the Kings
Philippe and Jean, and his great uncle, Duke Philippe
d’Orléans. To their own father, the sickly, studious
Charles V., who hated riding, war, and rough games,
but in whose reign, nevertheless, the English invaders
were driven out of France and the French navy
re-established; neither Charles VI. nor his young
brother Louis bore the slightest resemblance, except
that Louis had inherited, with the beauty and gallant
grace of the Valois, the love of books, art, and study,
which distinguished Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> By far the most
brilliant of the two brothers, he had been, at the time
of his father’s death, too young to give much indication
of what he would turn out like; indeed about the
only details mentioned respecting him are his beauty
and the admiration it excited at the last great
pageant of court,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> where just before his mother’s
death the Emperor was so splendidly received and
entertained; and the devout way in which he used
to say his prayers, kneeling before the image of the
Virgin. But the hasty, impetuous temper of Charles,
his incapacity for any serious study, his excitable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
unstable temperament, his passion for pleasure and
display, had been an anxiety and grief to his father,
who recognised in the boy all the qualities, attractions,
and faults of his race, which had already been
so fatal to France. In fact, as it often happens, the
lad was everything his father did not want him to be,
and Charles V., as long as he lived, used every means
in his power to counteract the tendencies which he
considered so dangerous. He forbade any love-stories
to be told to the Dauphin, and when on one
occasion one of the gentlemen of his household disobeyed
this order, dismissed him.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> He gave him
the best tutors that could be found, and tried to
influence and educate him by constant supervision.
At the earliest age his tutor observed his delight
in anything that had to do with war, and his father,
probably seeing that he would never make a scholar
or statesman, and thinking that he might perhaps
become a great leader and soldier, encouraged this
taste. One day he showed him the royal treasury
of crowns, jewels, and objects of inestimable value,
telling him to choose whatever he liked for himself.
The child looked around and pointed to a sword
which hung up in a corner of the room, and which
was given to him accordingly. Some days afterwards,
at a state banquet, the King caused to be
placed before him a soldier’s casque and a magnificent
crown of gold and precious stones, asking which
he would like best&mdash;to be crowned King with the
one, or to wear the other amidst the dangers of war.
Without hesitation the Dauphin replied, “Monseigneur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
I like the casque better than the crown.” This
answer delighted the nobles, who, amidst acclamations
of loyalty, swore to serve and defend the boy
whenever he should become their King, after which
Charles V. ordered the casque and sword to be hung
up by the Dauphin’s bed, and a little suit of armour
and weapons to be made for him,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> that so gallant
a spirit might be encouraged. If Charles V. and
Jeanne de Bourbon had lived to look after their
sons it seems most likely that the ruin and misery
which fell upon them and upon France might have
been averted.</p>

<p>For many years Charles V. had felt sure that his
life would not be a long one; but his hope was that
the Queen, who had good health, would survive him
and would be guardian to the children, her brother,
Louis de Bourbon&mdash;called “the good Duke Louis”&mdash;being
always at hand to help her. After the
irreparable calamity of her death, and finding his
own health rapidly breaking up, he did what he could
for his children by making the Duc de Bourbon
guardian to the young King and his brother, and
by preventing the Duc d’Anjou, who, as the eldest
of his brothers, had to be regent, from having more
power than he could help. The Ducs de Berry and
Bourgogne were also joined in the government of
the country and the young princes. With many
misgivings he entreated them to carry out his directions
and to bring up the King properly; nearly his
last words to them on the subject having been,
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Soignez-le, mes frères, et prenez grande attention de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
le bien former à la royauté, car l’enfant est jeune et
de l’esprit léger</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>Those princes did nothing of the kind. It is true
that the Princess Catherine was given into the sole
charge of her grandmother, the old Duchesse de
Bourbon, who since the Queen’s death had lived
a saintly life at the convent of St. Marcel; but
Charles and Louis were brought up together at the
hôtel St. Paul in an atmosphere of flattery, folly, and
corruption, which was eventually fatal to them both.
The three brothers of the late King were eager to
secure for themselves all the power and wealth they
could seize, and would not listen to the Duc de
Bourbon, who, as personal guardian only, and not
a brother of the late King, had less power and could
not oppose them. The lives led by the two boys
were what in our own days would be called fast
for a man ten years older, and eventually resulted
in the madness of Charles and the death of Louis.
The aim of their uncles was to keep them ignorant,
so that the reins of government might remain as long
as possible in their own hands. In this they only
partly succeeded, as Louis was very clever and fond
of study, but Charles hated books, application, or
restraint of any kind. They both rode well and
were good at all sorts of games and sports, and
the people, who had respected Charles V. and
adored Jeanne de Bourbon, now bestowed all their
affection on their young King, who was called
Charles le Bien-Aimé. To the end of his unfortunate
career he never lost either this name or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the affection of his people, for although he was hot-tempered
and imperious, so that he would never bear
the slightest opposition, he was brave, open-handed,
kind-hearted, and had those free, pleasant, courteous
manners that go farther in gaining friends&mdash;everywhere,
but most especially amongst the lower classes&mdash;than
a host of benefits and virtues. He was very faithful
and affectionate to his friends, never forgot the names
of the humblest people,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> but was always polite and
ready to talk to any one about anything.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> And
amidst the roughness and cruelty of the times it is
interesting to come upon the note of a sum paid to
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Colin le serrurier</i> for an iron <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i> to hang upon
a stag, which had been hunted by the King, had
taken refuge in a stable at Choisy, and had been
allowed by him to return to the forest&mdash;an example
of mercy which might well be placed before many
people in the present day who ought to be civilised
enough not to require it.</p>

<p>The King’s marriage and the beauty of Isabeau
delighted the people, and if she had possessed the
sense, talents, and good qualities of other queens
whose histories have been recorded in these volumes,
a great career would indeed have been open before
her. Advised and supported by the Duc de Bourbon
and the old friends and counsellors of Charles V.,
she could have retained her influence over the King
and held the reins of government when they dropped
from his hands. The voice of the nation would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
been with her, for it was weary of the oppression and
cruelty of the princes; and most of the fierce feuds
and bloodshed that came from the incapacity and
vices of all the chief members of the royal family
need never have happened.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Isabeau arrived at the French court
the chief members of the royal family were
the King, his brother Louis, Comte de Valois, and
Duc de Touraine, who, though only fourteen, was
already a soldier, having fought at the King’s side
in the battle of Rosebecques, in Flanders, when he was
scarcely twelve years old, wearing a small suit of
armour he had insisted on having made on purpose;
and the little Princess Catherine,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> who lived with
her grandmother at St. Marcel but came often to
Vincennes and the other palaces of her brother.
Next in rank were the two uncles of the King, the
Dukes of Berry and Burgundy, who, with the Duc
de Bourbon, were now regents and guardians of the
King and kingdom, for the Duc d’Anjou had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
adopted as her heir by Giovanna, Queen of Naples
and Sicily, and had left France for his new inheritance
two or three years before. Chief among the
princesses were the famous Queen Blanche of
Navarre, widow of Philippe de Valois, the King’s
great-grandfather; Blanche, Duchesse d’Orléans,
widow of Philippe, the King’s great uncle, and
daughter of Charles IV., the last king of the elder
Capétienne House; and Marguérite, Duchesse de
Bourgogne, the heiress of Flanders, wife of the last
Capétien and the first Valois Dukes of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>
In the case of the two last-named princesses, Charles
left his young wife at Creil when, a few days after
their wedding, he started for Flanders to make war
upon the contumacious city of Gand, or Ghent. He
returned in September and conducted the Queen
to Paris; but they did not then make a state entry
into the capital, as was usual on such occasions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1385}</div>

<p>Although the majority of the King had been fixed
at fourteen years by his father, who considered a boy
at that age a less objectionable ruler for France
than the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy; they had
managed to keep the government in their hands
until now. But Charles was exceedingly tired of
their interference and strongly urged on by Louis
and Isabeau, resolved to get rid of them. He
observed one day to his brother: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Beau frère, il est
temps que je gouverne comme a fait mon père, et je ne
veux souffrir mie l’autorité et volonté des beaux oncles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
de Berry et Bourgogne le peuple aussi trop fort s’en
plaint et souffre de leurs faits.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> And shortly afterwards
he informed his two uncles, much to their
consternation, that he intended for the future to
govern his own kingdom. But he took care to
keep with him his uncle Louis, Duc de Bourbon,
whom he loved. The frank, loyal, affectionate, and
sympathetic nature of the Duke, his chivalrous
tastes, and the really paternal care with which he
had watched over his nephews, had won their warmest
affection<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>; and now that his influence was no longer
weakened by their other uncles, immediate reforms
were the result of his wise counsels. Taxes were
reduced, certain corrupt officials dismissed, a truce
of three years was made with the English, the trusty
Juvenal des Ursins was made provost of Paris, and
all these measures were received with unqualified
approval throughout the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1386}</div>

<p>The extravagance of the court, and especially of the
royal family, prevented any improvements of this
kind from lasting long. No queen before her had
ever been consumed by such a passion for dress,
luxury, and pleasure, as Isabeau de Bavière; never
had such boundless extravagance been seen, even at
the brilliant court of the Valois.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Towards the end
of September of the year after the marriage of Charles
and Isabeau, a son was born to them at the château
de Beauté, the favourite resort of Charles V., on the
edge of the forest of Vincennes. The birth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Dauphin was, as usual, received with acclamations,
and proclaimed by couriers all over the kingdom. It
was also usual on such occasions that the King and
Queen should endow churches, remit taxes and debts,
and distribute alms to the poor. But they did none
of these things, and when, shortly after, the little
Dauphin Charles died, every one said that was the
reason, especially as during all that autumn there
were frightful storms, and it was said<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> that many
crows had been seen flying about, dropping hot ashes
from their beaks on the thatched roofs of barns, of
which many were set on fire.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1387}</div>

<p>It was the eve of the Holy Innocents when the
Dauphin died, and he was carried that night by torchlight,
with a grand procession of nobles, to St. Denis,
and buried there in the chapel of his grandfather,
Charles V. A daughter was Isabeau’s next child,
born at the Louvre in 1387. She was called Isabelle,
and married Richard II., King of England. In 1388
was born a second daughter, Jeanne, at the Maison
Royale de St. Ouen, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à l’heure de prime</i>. She died in
infancy.</p>

<p>In his interesting study of Isabeau de Bavière,
M. Vallet de Viriville says that in the portrait
painted of her in 1383 we see a young girl “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui
rayonnait d’innocence: telle elle était sortie des mains
de l’universel auteur</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and goes on to ask by what
means she could have fallen from such a height to
such a depth of infamy. But it seems improbable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
that this description could ever have applied to
Isabeau de Bavière. Except that she was remarkably
beautiful, we hear very little about her childhood.
The chroniclers of her father’s court indeed said that
she possessed admirable beauty, elegant manners, and
exquisite virtue. But at the time this was written,
Isabeau was probably twelve or thirteen years old;
and could hardly have done any great good or harm.
During her whole career, beginning at the day when,
at fourteen years old, she became Queen of France,
there does not seem to have been any great difference
in her way of going on; by which we may gather that
she was one of the sort of women one meets every
now and then who are always surrounded with a
turmoil of quarrels, discredit, and difficulties caused
by themselves, into which everybody who goes near
them is sure to be drawn. We meet them in novels,
we meet them in history, we meet them in real life;
and when we do, we know that there will be no more
peace till they are gone. But, fortunately, we do not
meet them as powerful and irresponsible rulers, like
Isabeau de Bavière. And we can perhaps imagine
what a calamity such a head of society was for
France.</p>

<p>Inordinately vain, selfish, capricious, too shallow
either really to love or hate, extravagant and yet
avaricious, with no sense and no scruples, this young
girl, scarcely out of childhood, not knowing a word of
French, and having been brought up in the distant
castle of a Bavarian noble, was suddenly placed at the
head of the court of France, the gayest and most
splendid in Europe, with every one at her feet, her will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
supreme except for the nominal control of a dissipated,
extravagant boy only two years older than herself,
and very much in love with her. Isabeau began by
introducing many foolish and exaggerated fashions in
dress which, with all their richness, had neither the
grace nor the distinction of the costume of the last
two or three reigns. For instance, she increased the
height of the tall headdresses called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hennins</i> so enormously
that those who wore them could not get
through the doors without stooping; some of them
also had horns. Very long pointed open sleeves were
worn, large wide sashes of silk or cloth of silver, and a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">surcot</i>, which was a sort of garment something like a
chasuble. Sometimes the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">surcots</i> had slits and openings
to show the dress underneath, of which the
preachers loudly complained. These <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">surcots</i> had been
worn in the former reigns. Dogskin and chamois-skin
boots and gloves lined with fur were also worn.
One of the court costumes was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">surcot</i> open at the
sides and a corsage of cloth of gold.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Evening dresses
were worn for the first time open at the neck and bosom,
and arms were no longer blazoned upon the robes.</p>

<p>As to men’s dress, the Valois had made a great
change about the middle of the fourteenth century.
Long tunics were quite done away with, and they
now wore short doublets and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">justaucorps</i> reaching to
the knee, hoods with long points hanging down to the
loins, round or pointed hats with plumes and brims
looped up behind, cloaks with scolloped edges, open
in front or behind, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chausses</i>, a kind of stockings of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
different colour for each leg and sometimes with soles
to them instead of shoes. Shoes were still worn with
points to the toes.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>The doublets and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">justaucorps</i> were of silk or velvet,
and sometimes padded with wadding so as not to
wrinkle; and worn with jewelled girdle, dagger, and
purse. They cut their hair short, and wore pointed
beards. Charles VI. wore short jackets with large
sleeves and short tunic. One of the most costly,
fashionable, and, it would seem, comfortable garments
was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">houppelande</i>, worn both by men and women.
This was an enormously long trailing robe or mantle
with loose sleeves, made of cloth, silk, or velvet, and
trimmed with fur and rich embroideries; high collar
and gold chains.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> It had not hitherto been customary
for the King himself to take part in the games and
sports which were the delight of the court, but Charles
who had of course as Dauphin been too young to ride
in joustes and tournaments, had no idea of being for
ever deprived of his favourite amusement, but distinguished
himself in the lists like the other young
chevaliers of his court.</p>

<p>The King’s uncles (brothers of Charles V.) were, as
has been before observed, most deplorable guides and
guardians to their nephews and France. The Duc de
Bourgogne was by far the best, as he had many noble
qualities, and his overwhelming pride and ambition
were at any rate not unsuitable to a great soldier and
the most powerful prince in France. The favourite
son and brother of the two last kings, he had stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
by his father’s side at Poitiers at thirteen years old,
fighting to the last, had been carried prisoner with
him to England, and had been rewarded by the
promise of the duchy of Burgundy, which was accordingly
conferred on him by his brother, Charles V.
At the coronation of his nephew, he had insisted on
taking precedence of his elder brother, the Duc
d’Anjou, much to the indignation of that prince; as
he contended that the duchy of Burgundy made him
the premier peer of France. He had married the
heiress of Flanders, widow at eleven years old of
Philippe de Rouvre, Duc de Bourgogne, and with that
haughty and determined princess he lived on terms
of such unbroken affection and confidence as to be the
wonder of the court. He was much influenced by her,
and, unlike most of the princes, no illegitimate child
was ever recognised as his.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>The Duc de Berry, without the great qualities of
his brother, was greedy after money, and a cruel
oppressor of the people, but he spent what he wrung
from them with royal magnificence in art, literature,
splendid palaces, and a great household.</p>

<p>The Duc d’Anjou was the handsomest of the
brothers, and the most unpopular, for he was just as
cruel and extortionate as the Duc de Berry, and did
not spend his money in Paris, but hoarded it up with
a view to providing the means of securing that Italian
kingdom of which he had always been dreaming, and
to which every one in France rejoiced when he had
gone. But he died in 1385, and his widow, Marie de
Bretagne, Queen-dowager of Sicily, was now at Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
with her two young sons, Louis II. and Charles, whose
guardian she was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1389}</div>

<p>In the early part of 1389, the Pope sent word to her
that an attempt was being made by another claimant
to get possession of the kingdom of Sicily. She went
at once to her nephew, asking for help, which Charles
was always ready to give on an occasion of this kind,
and before the young King of Sicily and his brother
started for that country he resolved to give a magnificent
fête in honour of their knighthood.</p>

<p>Great were the preparations for this ceremonial.
Proclamations were made and invitations issued all
over France, England, and Germany. It was arranged
that the fêtes should be at St. Denis, the place around
which have gathered for centuries the grandest, holiest,
and most solemn associations of the history of France.
Founded in 630 by Dagobert, the splendid church was
restored and decorated by its great Abbot,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Suger, in
1140. There, according to pious tradition, were transported
and buried the remains of St. Denis the
martyr, there hung the oriflamme, the flame-coloured
banner which had so often led the chivalry of France
to victory, there were the tombs of the kings, queens,
and royal family from Dagobert downwards, there, at
the feet of Charles V., was soon to be laid the hero
Du Guesclin. The splendour of the treasure of St.
Denis, which had delighted the eyes of the Emperor
Charles IV., was unsurpassed. Gold and silver
statues, crucifixes, and altar plate set with precious
stones, books covered with gold and silver, written in
letters of gold and ornamented with gems, gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
vestments, royal crowns of gold and jewels, the golden
sceptre and sword of Charlemagne, the hand of justice,
golden spurs, and coronation robes, all were in the
keeping of the Abbot of St. Denis, who was independent
of any other jurisdiction, and one of the greatest
nobles in France. Pope Stephen III. granted to the
monks of this great house the privilege of electing one
from their number to be consecrated Bishop and
receive the power of exercising all episcopal functions
in the abbey. The Abbots of St. Denis were also
permitted to wear the ring, mitre, and crozier, and the
pontifical vestments when they celebrated mass,
which on certain high festivals was sung in Greek.
From the kings they had the right to pardon
criminals, coin money, and hold fairs and markets, and
to sit as councillors in the parliament of Paris. Their
right, recognised by Louis le Gros, to the country of
the Vexin, gave them the oriflamme,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> which belonged
to it, and the war-cry of their feudal castle, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Montjoie
Saint Denis</i>,” was the war-cry of France.</p>

<p>Those delightful and invaluable historical works,
the “Grandes Chroniques de France,” were written
by the monks of St. Denis; of whom one used to
be chosen by the abbot to go about with the court
on purpose to write them. After the invention of
printing they were arranged and printed by the
Benedictine Jean Chartier, 1496.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
The ceremony of conferring knighthood was one
of the most interesting and characteristic of the
many spectacles of the Middle Ages. In a former
volume relating to the French court were described
the magnificent fêtes given by Philippe le Bel on the
occasion of the knighthood of his three sons and the
young Princes of Burgundy, the fame of which had
spread all over Christendom. Charles and Isabeau
determined that there should be no falling off either
in the splendour or the diversions of those they were
about to give. During the seventy-six years that
had elapsed between those festivities and the ones
now in question, wealth and luxury had greatly increased,
there was more general cultivation and no
gloomy figure severely moral and remorselessly cruel
cast a shadow, like Philippe le Bel, upon the universal
rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
The Queen, the ladies of the court, and princes of
the blood, were to lodge in the abbey itself, which
was well suited to receive them. The refectory was
of enormous size, with two naves divided by a
colonnade, the windows were filled with the most
gorgeous stained glass and the tables were of stone.
In the cloister was an ancient fountain thirty-six
feet in circumference, with sculptured figures from
heathen mythology, and over it a vault raised on
sixteen columns, mostly of marble, which had been
put there by Hugues VI. the forty-second abbot,
1197.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>A huge wooden hall was built for the occasion in
the courtyard of the abbey. It was covered with
white outside, lined with white and green and decorated
with tapestries and cloth of gold. In it was a
large dais, and outside a place for tournaments with
wooden galleries for the ladies to look on at the
spectacle. On Saturday, May 1st, about sunset, the
King arrived, and soon after the Queen of Sicily in
an open car accompanied by the princes of the blood,
her two sons, the King of Sicily, then about twelve
years old, and his brother rode by her side in long
grey robes without any gold or ornament, carrying
pieces of the same stuff rolled up on their saddles as
if for a journey, after an ancient custom of esquires.
They escorted their mother to the abbey and then
proceeded to the priory de l’Estrée, where they undressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
and bathed. At nightfall they went to
salute the King, who took them to the church, where
they put on the dress of knighthood. It was of red
silk lined with vair, long robes and mantles down to
the ground, but no covering on the head. Then a
great procession was formed, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> of nobles
going before and behind the young King of Sicily,
who walked between the Dukes of Burgundy and
Touraine, and his brother, who was accompanied by
the Duc de Bourbon and Pierre de Navarre, Comte
de Mortaigne.</p>

<p>After prayers before the holy relics the procession
returned with the same state to the great banquet,
after which the King went to bed and the King of
Sicily and his brother returned to the church to pass
the night in prayer and watching before the altar
according to the ancient usage. But young as the
children were, and tired with the journey and the
fatigues of all these ceremonies, it was evident that
they would not be able to sit up all night in church
saying prayers, so after a little while they were
fetched away to rest until daybreak, when they had
to go back; and later in the morning came the
imposing function in the church. It was crowded
with the courtiers and nobles, all the monks were
also present, and when the rest were assembled a
door was opened out of the cloisters and two of the
chief esquires of the King’s household appeared
carrying drawn swords and golden spurs, and followed
by the King himself in his royal robes and
mantle, accompanied by the two young princes.</p>

<p>Immediately after came the Queens of France and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Sicily with their ladies. A solemn mass was then
sung, at the conclusion of which the bishop approached
the King, and the two boys knelt before
him and demanded admission to knighthood. The
King received their vows, girded on their swords, and
commanded M. de Chauvigny to put on their spurs,
the Bishop gave them his blessing, and the picturesque
and touching ceremony was at an end.</p>

<p>Every one returned to the abbey, where there was
a grand banquet, in fact two, for the monk of St.
Denis who gives the account of it says that they
dined and supped in the banqueting hall with the
King and court and then danced all night.</p>

<p>It may interest some people to know that a granddaughter
of the elder of these boys was the famous
and unfortunate Marguérite d’Anjou, wife of Henry
VI., King of England.</p>

<p>For four days and nights joustes and tournaments
went on, at which the Queen gave away the prizes;
followed by banquets and balls. The court was in a
frenzy of excitement and the fêtes ended with a
masked ball more splendid than any, but so licentious
and disorderly that of the brilliant crowds that
thronged the torch-lighted halls and wandered in the
dim, tapestried galleries and rooms of the great
abbey, it has been asserted that few escaped the
perils of that night of wild, lawless revelry; and the
monk of Saint Denis declares that the scenes
enacted there desecrated the holiness of the place.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
A liaison between Isabeau and her brother-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the Duc de Touraine was said to be one of the
results, and it has certainly been the general opinion
that whether or not it originated on that occasion,
there could be only one explanation to the relations
which from that time until the death of the Duke
continued to exist between them.</p>

<p>It is true that M. Jarry<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> in his interesting work on
Louis d’Orléans observes that this has never been
proved, and that M. Vallet de Viriville makes the
same remark; but he adds “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tout le dit, rien ne le
prouve. Louis, duc d’Orléans, etait le vice aimable.
Pour cette fille d’Ève, si prête à faillir et trop aisée à
charmer, il eut la séduction du Tentateur</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Louis
was one of the handsomest, most fascinating, and
most dissipated men in France, and his liaisons were
innumerable. It was said that he wore a magic ring,
and that as long as it was on his finger no woman
could resist him. It was, in fact, a reproach made
by his enemies that he wore it in the Holy Week.
Between such a man as this and a woman like
Isabeau, can any one believe that the most constant,
intimate, and unrestrained companionship was likely
to be of a different nature from what was universally
believed?</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that the order of knighthood
did not in itself confer the right to raise a
banner. This privilege belonged only to such
gentlemen as bore the rank of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevalier banneret</i>”
and owned enough land to enable them to support it.
The others were called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevalier bachelier</i>” and bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a pennon or small pointed flag, whereas the banner
was square. If a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevalier bachelier</i> were raised to be
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevalier banneret</i>, he had first to prove that his
property was sufficient to qualify him for that
dignity. When Sir John Chandos, after having long
held high military command, though not a knight
banneret, asked the Black Prince for the right to
raise a banner, he said, “Thank God I have enough
and to spare in lands and in inheritance to keep up
that rank as it is fitting.”</p>

<p>The next thing of importance that happened at
court was a most absurd marriage made by the Duc
de Berry, which, however, seems to have turned out
very well.</p>

<p>There was a certain Eléonore, daughter and heiress
of the Comte de Comminges, who had married the
son of that Comte de Boulogne et d’Auvergne, to
whom those two provinces had fallen after the death
of the young Philippe de Rouvre and the end of the
Capétienne house of Burgundy, which, as will be
remembered, took place in the reign of Jean.</p>

<p>The marriage of Eléonore de Comminges turned
out unhappily, so she resolved to leave her husband,
whose prodigality and neglect she could not bear
any longer, and take refuge with her uncle, the
Comte d’Urgel, who was a son of the King of
Aragon. Taking her only child, a girl of three years
old, she contrived to escape out of the dominions of
her father-in-law and journeyed south towards those
of her uncle. On the way she passed near Orthez, a
castle of the famous Gaston, Comte de Foix, who was
a cousin of hers and of whom she asked hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Now Gaston Phœbus was that Comte de Foix
whose deeds have been described in the life of
Blanche de Navarre. He was separated from his
wife, the Princess Agnes of Navarre, who had gone
back to her own family. He was supposed to have
stabbed his only legitimate son in a fit of rage, and
he now lived with several illegitimate sons and a
mistress who was one of the chief causes of the
departure of the Princess Agnes.</p>

<p>But he was a man of many and varied talents;
passionately fond of music, a great soldier, an
excellent governor of the province entrusted to him
by Charles V., and a powerful ally and friend to any
one he liked. He received his cousin with great
kindness and affection and into his ears she poured
the history of her wrongs; her anger against her
husband and her resolve to obtain the restitution of
Comminges, her inheritance, which had been wrongfully
seized by the Comte d’Armagnac. As to her
husband, she said, “he cares nothing about it, he is
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trop mal chevalier</i>, all he cares for is to eat, drink, and
waste his property; if he got Comminges he would
only sell it for his follies, and besides, I cannot live
with him. With great trouble I have taken and
extracted my daughter out of the hands and country
of my husband’s father, and I have brought her to
you to ask you to be her guardian and take care of
her. Her father will be rejoiced when he knows she
is with you, for he told me he had doubts about her
birth.”</p>

<p>Gaston de Foix, who seems to have taken a fancy
to the child, willingly agreed, and his cousin continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
her journey, leaving the child, who was from
that time brought up by him as his own daughter in
his castle.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>The Comtesse d’Auvergne occasionally came to
see her daughter, but she always lived with her
adopted father. At the time we are now concerned
with, the Duc de Berry, who was a widower, and
nearly fifty years of age, attracted by the riches and
beauty of the child, now twelve years old, wanted to
marry her, much to the disapprobation of the King,
who thought it ridiculous. “Bel oncle,” he said, “what
can you want with a child (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">une fillette</i>) like that?
She is only twelve years old and you are fifty! It is
absurd for you to think of such a thing. Ask for
her for my cousin Jean, your son, who is of a proper
age for her; the affair would be much more suitable
for him than for you.”</p>

<p>To which the Duke replied that he had already
done so, but the Comte de Foix would not hear
of it, as, by his late mother, Jean descended from
the Comtes d’Auvergne, whom he hated; and that
if the child were too young the marriage could
remain a form for three or four years, until she was
grown up.</p>

<p>The King laughed, again advised him not to
proceed with the matter, but said that as he persisted
he would see to it. Therefore he sent Bureau de la
Rivière to treat with the Comte de Foix, to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the Duke gave 3,000 francs for his care of the young
girl, who was quite ready to be Duchesse de Berry,
did not care a bit for the age of the Duke, but was
delighted to marry so exalted a personage as the
King’s uncle. The Comte de Foix sent her with an
escort of five hundred lances, she was met by five
hundred more with litters, chariots, and splendid
dresses sent by the Duc de Berry, to whom she was
married amid much festivity in presence of her father
and other great nobles. And thus was an aunt of
twelve years old added to the youthful royal family
of France.</p>

<p>The Duc de Berry was delighted with the little
Duchess, so were the King and Queen; she became
an immense favourite at court, seems to have got
on extremely well with the Duke and to have
thoroughly enjoyed herself in her new life. She
always expressed her gratitude to Bureau de la
Rivière for bringing about her marriage, and, as
will be seen later, he had every reason to congratulate
himself that he had done so. When, after many
years, the Duc de Berry died and she married again,
she was not happy with her new husband and soon
left him.</p>

<p>Just after this marriage came that of Louis, Duc
de Touraine with Valentine Visconti, daughter of
Gian Galeazzo Visconti and Isabelle de France, and
consequently cousin both to the King and Queen.
For it will be remembered that the Queen’s mother
was a Visconti; while Isabelle de France was that
little daughter of King Jean who was married so
much against her will to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
who had lived in Italy in great magnificence and
honour; for the Visconti were delighted with the
alliance, and the birth of her daughter (who was also
granddaughter to the King of France) was received
with great rejoicings all over the dominions of her
father-in-law. Isabelle died in 1373, and Valentine
was for a long time the only child of her father,
as none of Isabelle’s three sons grew to manhood,
and when, seven years later, he married Caterina
Visconti, no children were born to them for eight
years. Valentine, therefore, was a great heiress, and
was sought in marriage all over Europe. But
Gian Galeazzo, a quiet, rather shy man of studious
tastes, always surrounded with ecclesiastics and
learned men from all countries, would not part with
the daughter who was his constant companion. For
Valentine was clever and fond of learning, she read
and spoke Latin, French, and German, and shared
in the literary pursuits of her father and the cultivated
circle in which they lived. A mysterious and sinister
reputation hung over Gian Galeazzo Visconti. He
was said to carry his researches beyond the lawful
limits of human knowledge. It was whispered that
the death of his uncle, Bernabo Visconti, might be
traced to a subtle poison administered at his instigation,
and what at that time caused even more terror
than that of poison and assassination was the suspicion
of sorcery that clung to him and attached itself
afterwards to his daughter and even his son-in-law.
In spite of the roughness, cruelty, and callousness
prevailing in those days north of the Alps, the
French regarded the Italians with feelings of mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
fear, curiosity, and admiration. The glory of Italian
art, the splendour of Italian cities, the superior
comfort and luxury of life in those immense palaces
in that delicious climate, the fearful deeds done in
the dungeons of the Italian tyrants, the learning and
wisdom of the scholars and students who pored by
day over books and manuscripts and watched the
heavens from tower and loggia on starry, southern
nights, who knew how to read their future from
the stars and to destroy their enemies with a ring
or a bunch of flowers; all this took firm hold on
the imagination of their northern neighbours, and
made them look upon Italy as a land full of romance,
mystery, and supernatural dangers.</p>

<p>Valentine was twenty years of age when, in 1386,
her father consented to her betrothal to the brother
of the King of France. The marriage was much
desired by the French as, besides Valentine’s
enormous fortune, it would bring back to France
the county of Vertus, the dowry of Isabelle, and
also give her Asti, a whole province of towns, villages,
and castles, which would be a footing for the French
in Italy.</p>

<p>It was not until the summer of 1389 that Valentine
left her father on her journey to France. It was
afterwards reported at Paris that the Duke of Milan
said to her, “Fair daughter, when I see you again
I trust you will be Queen of France;” but this is
probably untrue, more especially as Gian Galeazzo,
who had kept her as long as he could, rode with her
out of the gates of Pavia and then turned, without a
word of farewell, and rode silently back, not daring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
to look once more into her beloved face. In the
saddest of her tragic life Valentine remembered with
tears that silent parting.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>The King, Queen, Duc de Touraine, all the princes
and the whole court were waiting at Melun, where
the marriage was celebrated with suitable magnificence
and much festivity. Valentine fell deeply in
love with the Duc de Touraine, although he was five
years younger than herself. She was not remarkably
handsome, but very attractive, and in spite of the
perpetual infidelities of Louis her devotion to him
never changed, and she also lived on good terms
with the Queen, notwithstanding the disposition of
Isabeau to entertain for her a jealousy which might
well have been reversed. Isabeau was then eighteen,
in the height of her beauty, the idol of the court and
people, all the more as she was again <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enceinte</i>, and
the hopes of every one were fixed on the birth of a
Dauphin.</p>

<p>Valentine was as superior to Isabeau as light to
darkness. Ambitious, cultivated, with brilliant intellectual
powers, strong both to love and hate, brave
and gentle, no shadow of reproach rests on her
name.</p>

<p>The King took a great fancy to her and used to
call her his beloved sister. She and Louis seem
to have got on very harmoniously and affectionately
together on the whole, by which one must conclude
she must have been a woman of extraordinary tact
and patience in some matters.</p>

<p>She brought with her a most gorgeous trousseau of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
clothes and jewels; amongst her many dresses was
a scarlet one sewn thick with pearls and diamonds,
and a cap of scarlet and pearls for the hair; another
of gold brocade with sleeves and headdress of woven
pearls.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Although</span> it was now four years since her
marriage with Charles VI., Isabeau had never
been crowned; and although she had of course often
been in Paris, she had not made any ceremonial entry
into that city.</p>

<p>But she had no idea of giving up the honours
usually conferred on the Queens of France; and the
King, always delighted at the idea of any new festival,
made inquiries as to how these state entries had
been arranged in the times of his predecessors, so
that nothing might be wanting in magnificence on
the present occasion.</p>

<p>There was one member of the royal family who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
was considered a great authority on these and many
other matters. The famous Blanche de Navarre,
although she had been Queen-dowager for forty-one
years and was the widow of the King’s great-grandfather,
Philippe de Valois, was only about fifty-nine
years old, had been in her youth the brightest star
of the Valois court, and all her life one of the most
brilliant, powerful, and popular women of her century.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
To her Charles applied for advice, and into her hands
he gave authority to regulate every detail of the whole
ceremony. She consulted the records kept at St.
Denis, and from those and her own recollections she
arranged one of the most splendid pageants known to
history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1389}</div>

<p>The Queen went from Melun to St. Denis, where
she stayed two days until the royal family and court
were assembled. On Sunday, August 17th, at midday,
the procession started for Paris. Isabeau, dressed
in a silk robe covered with golden <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i>, was in a
gorgeous open litter, followed by Queen Blanche, the
Duchesses of Burgundy, Berry, and Bar, the Comtesse
de Nevers, and the Dame de Coucy, all in their
litters. The royal dukes on horseback surrounded
the Queen’s litter, and among them rode Valentine,
Duchesse de Touraine, on a horse covered with
trappings embroidered with gold. Each litter was
escorted by a troop of cavaliers, and burghers dressed
in red and green, and mounted on horses with
trappings of the same colours, lined the road from
St. Denis to Paris, from the gates of which issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
a brilliant crowd, shouting, “Vive le roi! Vive la
reine! Noël! Noël!”</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> entered Paris by the Porte aux Peintres
into the rue St. Denis, which was draped from top to
bottom with crimson and green covered with gold
stars. At every turn was some new spectacle. As
Isabeau entered Paris she passed under an artificial
sky, with clouds, stars, the three Persons of the
Trinity, and a troop of children dressed like angels,
two of whom descended singing a verse in her
honour, and placed a crown of gold and jewels on
her head; and as she passed over one of the bridges
which had been covered with silken curtains, they
were suddenly divided, and a man with another
crown flew down a cord from the tower of Notre
Dame, and flew up again with a lighted torch in each
hand, which, as it was already getting dark, could be
seen by all Paris. Wine was flowing all day and
night from fountains and taps in the streets and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carrefours</i>; in open-air theatres plays and “mysteries”
were acted, the houses were hung with rich stuffs and
costly tapestries. The procession had stopped at St.
Lazare, where the Queen put on her crown and the
princesses and duchesses their coronets, the princes
of the blood and nobles dismounting and ranging themselves
by the litters of the Queen and ladies; then
proceeding to Notre Dame they entered the church,
made a short prayer, and went on to the Palais de la
Cité, where they supped.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>Next day the King in his royal robes, scarlet
mantle glittering with jewels, and crown on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
head, entered the chapel of the Palais. The Queen,
also covered with scarlet and jewels, and with her
hair flowing on her shoulders, knelt before the altar,
saluted the King, mounted on to a high dais covered
with cloth of gold, and was anointed and crowned
by the Archbishop of Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>Then there was a splendid fête in the great hall of
the Palais de la Cité, the most ancient of all the
palaces of the Kings of France. This hall was considered
one of the largest and finest in the world. It
was paved with black and white marble and panelled
and vaulted with wood, rows of columns went down
it, decorated with gold and blue and adorned with the
statues of the Kings of France; those who were distinguished
and fortunate having their hands raised,
while the hands of those who were bad rulers, weak,
or unlucky hung down. At one end, going right down
it, was an enormous table, so long, so wide, and so
thick that it was said that never were there such huge
blocks of marble as those of which it was composed.
It stood there for hundreds of years, and was used for
great banquets. At it dined only Emperors, Kings,
and other Princes and Princesses of the blood royal,
peers of France and their wives; the rest of the nobles
and courtiers sat at other tables. This huge table
was also used as a stage for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clercs de la Basoche</i>
for their plays and mummeries during two or three
hundred years.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>It was very hot, and there was a great crowd at the
joustes and banquet, the Queen and several of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
ladies nearly fainted. The King ordered a barrier
to be broken down to let in air, and the tables withdrawn
(“levées”) to let them go out “without wine
or spices” (dessert).</p>

<p>The King, who took no part in the entry, which
was in honour of the Queen alone, had nevertheless
managed to amuse himself very well, and had seen
the whole spectacle in disguise. “Savoisy,” he said
to his chamberlain, “I want you to get on a good
horse, and I will get up behind you; we will disguise
ourselves so that no one will know us, and go and see
my wife’s entry.”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>They mingled in the crowd, seeing and hearing
much that diverted them, and the King afterwards
told the Queen and ladies all his adventures with
great delight.</p>

<p>Some of the ladies left and went to their own hôtels
when the King and Queen retired, but many remained
all night, and the next morning the Queen and court
moved to the hôtel St. Paul, where the revels went
on for six days more, with a license that again
called forth the reproaches and indignation of the
preachers.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>Splendid presents were given by the City of
Paris and by different people to the Queen and
the Duchesse de Touraine, whose first appearance
among them had excited great curiosity and interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
The Duc de Berry gave Isabeau a large house in the
faubourg St. Marcel, with courts, galleries, moats,
gardens, meadows, and a rabbit warren.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>The fatigue and excitement of all these gaieties
seem to have told upon her, for she could not be
present at a banquet and dance given by the King
to the ladies of the court during the festivities at
St. Paul, but stayed in her room and supped there.</p>

<p>She did not accompany the King when early in
October he set off on a journey south. He had
received great complaints from Aquitaine<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> of the
oppressions and extortions of the Duc de Berry,
and he also wanted to attend the coronation at
Avignon of the young King of Sicily. The Queen
being <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enceinte</i> could not take a long and tiring
journey, besides which it is more than probable
that Charles on this occasion greatly preferred her
absence. For his progress through Provence, Guyenne,
and Languedoc, though ostensibly for political objects,
such as the extinction of the schism at Avignon, the
coronation of the King of Sicily, and the reformation
of the abuses in Aquitaine, had also its social
side. There, in the land of troubadours, poetry,
and courts of love, where the sun was burning and
the nights were bright, where the imagination was
more vivid and the hot blood of the south ran
quicker through the veins, where manners and
morals were easy and had a tinge of orientalism
derived from contact with the East; the progress
of the young King from one town to another was
a saturnalia of dancing, feasting, love-making, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
violent exercise in games and tournaments, which
for the first time seem to have taken visible effect
upon him.</p>

<p>Some symptoms he must have felt which troubled
and alarmed him, for while at Avignon he caused an
effigy of himself to be made life-size in wax and
placed under a tabernacle close to the relics of the
young Cardinal Pierre de Luxembourg, of saintly
reputation, to whose tomb people were flocking to
be cured of epilepsy and other maladies.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>There was no royal post at that time; it was not
instituted till the reign of Louis XI. Charles sent a
courier to the Queen two or three weeks after his
departure, to ask for news of her; he was then in
Dauphiné, and from that time until his return in
March she seems to have had no more letters or
communications from him.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>During his absence another daughter was born and
named Jeanne, like the first one. Isabeau had now
two daughters still living. This second Jeanne afterwards
married the Duc de Bretagne.</p>

<p>M. Vallet de Viriville says of Isabeau that although
frivolous, capricious, and fantastic, she seems to have
been liked by her ladies, and was certainly just as
fond of her children as other women usually are.
While they were little she had them always with
her, caressed and watched over them, wept and
prayed when they were ill, and redoubled her lamentations
when any of them died. Her neglect of them
a little later on, however, seems to contradict this; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
then Isabeau was a person so inconsistent and selfish
that neither her affection nor her dislike could ever
be reckoned upon; and her extravagance and folly
was the cause of the penury to which the royal
children were at one time reduced. Her quarrels
with her sons in later years were long after they
had passed childhood; with those of her daughters
who lived to grow up she does not seem to have
disagreed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1390}</div>

<p>The Queen and the Duchesse de Touraine had
been left together at Beauté by their husbands
when they started for the south.</p>

<p>After an absence of several months, spent as has
been described, those young princes turned their
steps northwards again. When they arrived at
Montpellier the King told his brother that he felt
so impatient to see the Queen and Duchesse de
Touraine again that he could not wait any longer,
but proposed that they should race back to Paris;
a bet of 5,000 francs to be paid to the winner.
Louis agreed, and they set off, riding day and
night, changing horses very frequently and being
carried in litters when it was absolutely necessary
to take a little rest. The race was won by Louis,
who got on to a boat at Troyes and went down
the Seine to Melun, thus getting rest all that part
of the way. At Melun he disembarked and rode
on to Paris, where he arrived some hours before
the King, having done it in four days and a half.</p>

<p>Louis went straight to see the Queen, and then
presented himself before his brother and claimed
the 5,000 francs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
This adventure does not seem to have done Louis
any harm, but it was declared by the doctors to have
been most injurious to Charles, and to have helped to
over-excite and unsettle his brain.</p>

<p>The King returned from his southern tour weakened,
exhausted, and very angry with all he had found out
about the oppressions and cruelties of the Duc de
Berry. He had held a Parliament at Toulouse,
punished some of the officials, dismissed others, and
tried to redress some of the worst grievances. But
though Charles was generous and kind-hearted,
neither he nor his brother nor any of his uncles,
except the Duc de Bourbon, had any idea how to
govern, and the latter was entirely opposed to the
Dukes of Berry and Burgundy; so much so, indeed,
that a melancholy romance was the result of their
dissensions.</p>

<p>The youngest daughter of the Duke of Burgundy
had been, in 1386, betrothed to the Comte de Clermont,
son of the Duc de Bourbon. But they were too
young at the time for the marriage to take place, and
meanwhile the quarrels of their families caused it to
be broken off. They appear, however, to have been
deeply attached to each other, for Bonne de Bourgogne,
or, as she is named in her epitaph, Bonne
d’Artois, declared that she would have no other
husband than the Comte de Clermont, and, after
refusing every other alliance suggested to her, died
at Arras, 1399. The Comte de Clermont also refused
to marry any one else as long as she lived.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>The Queen was again <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enceinte</i>, and the court were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
at Saint Germain-en-Laye for the summer. Money
was wanted, as usual, for the extravagant follies of
the royal household, and in spite of the compassion
of the King for the suffering of the people, it was
proposed to levy new taxes.</p>

<p>It was a calm, cloudless day in July; the
Council was sitting, the King presiding, and the
Queen had gone to mass in her private chapel,
when suddenly the sky became black with
clouds, forked lightning flashed through the darkness
accompanied by awful claps of thunder,
and a violent wind tore the windows from
their hinges and shattered all the panes of glass
in the Queen’s Chapel. Mass had to be finished
low and hurriedly lest the Host<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> be torn out of
the hands of the officiating priest, the palace seemed
to shake, and everybody was prostrate with terror.
The Queen went trembling to the King, saying
that this was an expression of the anger of God
for their oppression of the people, and they had
better give up the new taxes. The Council was
dismissed accordingly and the taxes abandoned.
Many trees were torn up in the forest, and four
officers of the royal household killed by the lightning.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
Isabeau had always the greatest terror of
a thunderstorm; she had a vaulted cellar under the
Palais de la Cité on purpose to take refuge in on
those occasions.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>The much longed for Dauphin was born on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
6th of February, 1391, at the hôtel St. Paul. The
King was asleep, for it was in the middle of the
night, but the tidings were soon brought to him
and to all Paris, which was at once plunged into
a tumult of rejoicing. The bells of all the churches
were ringing, couriers were starting for all parts of
the kingdom, the streets were filled with people and
torches, and set with tables covered with wine and
food at which stood ladies of the highest rank,
offering them freely to all who passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1392}</div>

<p>The Dauphin was baptized next day in the church
of St. Paul, his god-parents being Blanche, Duchess-dowager
of Orléans, the Duke of Burgundy, and
Comte de Daumartin.</p>

<p>In the following May was born, also at the hôtel
St. Paul, the eldest son of Louis and Valentine. He
was also named Charles. The Duc de Bourbon was
his godfather. He afterwards married the Princess
Isabelle, eldest daughter of Charles VI.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>The Duchess-dowager of Orléans, Blanche de
France, died in February, 1392, after a long and
painful illness. She was greatly respected and
honoured, and her funeral at St. Denis was attended
by the whole of the royal family and court. She
was daughter of Charles IV. and Jeanne d’Evreux,
and, as she on one occasion remarked to King
Philippe de Valois, if she had been a man she would
have been king instead of him. She was proud,
high-spirited, and so charitable that she had given
away nearly all her fortune before she died.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
The King gave the duchy of Orléans to his brother
instead of that of Touraine.</p>

<p>A conference was held at Amiens between the
Dukes of Lancaster and York, uncles of Richard
II., and the French King with the Dukes of Burgundy
and Berry. The four dukes entered Amiens riding
side by side so as to avoid questions of precedence.
It was remarked that the English dukes were dressed
with great simplicity in cloth of greenish brown,
while the Duke of Burgundy had his clothes covered
with pearls, rubies, and sapphires. They could not
agree on terms of lasting peace, so they arranged
a truce for a year longer, and then separated. But
Charles, who, during the whole fortnight had not
troubled himself at all about the negotiations, but
passed the time in feasting and amusements, had
made himself very ill with an attack of fever and had
to be taken in a litter to Beauvais, where he stayed in
the bishop’s palace till he was well again.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>Amongst the constant companions of the King and
the Duc d’Orléans was a certain Pierre de Craon.
He was a particular favourite of Louis, they often
dressed alike, and Craon was the confidant of all the
duke’s love affairs, which were innumerable. There
was a girl in Paris whose beauty he had for some
time admired and to whom he had offered 1,000
crowns if she would consent to become his mistress.
She appears to have been hesitating about the matter,
and meanwhile, Louis took Craon to see her. Craon
had the rashness to go and tell the whole story to the
Duchesse d’Orléans, with the result he might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
expected. Valentine was very angry and sent for
the girl, who appeared before her trembling with
fear.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Valentine, “so you wish to take
monseigneur away from me?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Madame, God forbid,” answered the girl,
beginning to cry, “I should not dare even to think of
such a thing.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Valentine, “I know all about
it. Monseigneur loves you and you love him, things
have even gone so far that he has offered you 1,000
crowns, but you have refused and you have done
well. For this time I forgive you, and I forbid you,
as you value your life, to have for the future anything
to do with monseigneur. Dismiss him.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The girl retired, thankful to have escaped so well,
and the next time the Duke called she fled from him,
refusing to show him the least sign of affection.
Much astonished and disappointed he asked what
was the matter. She began to cry and reproached
him with having betrayed her either to the Duchess
or to somebody else who had told her, and went on
to say, “you had better try to recollect to whom you
have been making confidences. I am dreadfully
afraid of Madame la Duchesse, and I have promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and sworn never to have any communication with
you. I am not going to excite her jealousy.”</p>

<p>“Ma belle dame,” replied Louis, “I swear to you
that I would rather lose a hundred thousand francs
than betray you. Since you have promised, keep your
oath, but at any cost I will find out who has revealed
our secrets.”</p>

<p>Therefore Louis went that night to supper with his
wife, to whom he made himself as pleasant as he
well knew how to do. By soft words, love-making
and persuasion he prevailed upon her to tell him that
it was Pierre de Craon who had revealed the affair
to her.</p>

<p>Next morning he rode to the Louvre in a furious
rage and met the King going to Mass. Charles, who
was very fond of him, seeing his disturbed looks,
stopped and asked what was the cause of them.
Louis poured out his indignation to his brother,
adding that besides this, Craon was always reproaching
him with his love of necromancy. “To hear him,” he
said, “one would think I was a wizard. By the faith
I owe you, monseigneur, if it were not for my respect
for you I would kill him.”</p>

<p>“Do not do that,” replied Charles. “I will send
him word that I have no further occasion for his
services and he is to leave my hôtel; you can turn
him out of yours too.” Accordingly that day the
Sires de la Rivière and de Noviant from the King,
and two gentlemen of the household of the Duc
d’Orléans, brought orders to Craon to retire.</p>

<p>He demanded an explanation, but neither the
King nor the Duke would see him. Unable to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
any information, and vowing vengeance against the
unknown enemy, he retired to the court of his cousin,
the Duc de Bretagne, and, after consulting together,
they came to the conclusion that it must have been
the Constable de Clisson who had done this, and
resolved to avenge themselves on him.</p>

<p>Pierre de Craon therefore returned secretly to
Paris and concealed himself in his hôtel, which was a
splendid house, and which he had well stored with
food and necessaries, and in his anxiety that his
presence should not be known, he even took
the precaution of locking up the wife and
daughter of his concierge for fear they should disclose
it.</p>

<p>On the 13th June there was a fête at the hôtel St.
Paul. There were joustes in the afternoon and then
a supper, followed by a ball which went on until
about an hour after midnight.</p>

<p>The Constable de Clisson was the last to depart.
He took leave of the King and Duc d’Orléans, and
then, with eight <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">valets</i> of whom two carried torches,
he proceeded towards the rue St. Catherine, at the
corner of which Craon was lying in wait for him with
a band of forty brigands. As he rode down the
street, on a sudden the torches were snatched from
his men and thrown to the ground. Clisson thought
it was a trick of Louis d’Orléans and called out, “By
my faith, monseigneur, this is too bad, but I forgive
you because you are young and think of nothing but
jokes.” But to his astonishment the answer was,
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A mort! à mort Clisson! Si vous faut mourir</i>,” as
Craon drew his sword and with the gang of assassins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
attacked the Constable, who, after defending himself
desperately, was flung from his horse against the
door of a baker’s shop which gave way and he fell
down two steps into the house. The baker and his
people rushed out to pick him up, and the assassins,
most of whom only now discovered that they had
been hired to murder the Constable of France, fled in
terror. Craon rode for his life through the Porte
Saint Antoine, gained his own castle of Sablé, and
from thence got safe to Bretagne. Meanwhile, the
news spread rapidly through the city. The King
who was going to bed, was just undressing in the
hôtel St. Paul, when he was told that his Constable
had been murdered.</p>

<p>“Murdered! My Constable! By whom?” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It is not known, but it is close by, in the rue St.
Catherine.”</p>

<p>“Torches! quick!” cried the King. “I shall go
and see him.” And without waiting for guards or
suite, he threw a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">houppelande</i> round him, and rushed
out, arriving at the shop just as the Constable was
beginning to recover his senses. He opened his
eyes and they fell upon the young King leaning
anxiously over him. “Ah, Constable, how do you
feel?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cher sire, bien faiblement et petitement.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Et qui vous a mis en ce parti?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sire, Pierre de Craon et ses complices, trâitreusement
et sans défense.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Charles turned to the doctor who had been hastily
called in and said, “Look at my Constable, and tell
me what there is to fear.”<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Delighted to hear that
although Clisson was covered with wounds, his life
was in no danger, and swearing that never had a
crime been punished and avenged as this should be;
Charles sent in pursuit of Craon and his companions,
of whom some were taken and executed, but most of
them escaped.</p>

<p>The King confiscated his dominions, took possession
of his treasures, and divided his lands between
the Duc d’Orléans and some of his friends. The wife
and daughter of Craon fled, and the King ordered the
Duc de Bretagne to give up the traitor who had
attacked his Constable.</p>

<p>The Duke pretended not to know where he was, so
Charles assembled his troops to go to war with him,
ordering his uncles of Berry and Burgundy to join
him with their vassals. They both hated this project
as the Duke of Burgundy was a great friend of the
Duc de Bretagne, and the Duc de Berry, who was in
Paris at the time, had been told of the conspiracy the
very day it was carried out, but as he could not bear
the Constable he said nothing about it to the King
on pretence of not wishing to disturb the festivities
going on at the palace. However, they were forced
to obey the King, who would not listen to their assurances
that Craon was not there at all, but in Spain.
He threw himself into a violent passion whenever the
matter was discussed, and seemed to be growing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
violent and so unreasonable that all who approached
him were filled with alarm.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>The weather was very hot, and Charles was in a
perfectly unfit state to bear the fatigue and excitement
of a campaign. During the whole summer it
had been so dry that the large rivers, the chief roads
for merchandise, had been so low that boats could
not go on them, wells and springs were dried up, the
parched earth cracked; there was great distress, for no
rain fell.</p>

<p>One broiling day he insisted, in spite of the advice
of his uncles, on leaving Le Mans with the troops.
He was dressed in black velvet, and almost suffocated
with the heat.</p>

<p>As they were entering a wood a tall figure rushed
out and caught his horse by the bridle, crying out
that he was betrayed (which by the by is the typical
exclamation of the modern Frenchman). This particular
man, however, appears to have been mad, and
while he was raving and warning the King not to go
further he was seized by the guards.</p>

<p>Charles said nothing at first, but rode on for about
an hour till the troop came out of the wood on to a
sandy plain where the dust and heat were overpowering.
One of the pages, who was so exhausted that
he was falling asleep, let his spear fall against some
one else’s armour. The clang it made startled the
King, who suddenly gave a shout and rode furiously
forward striking at everybody. He struck down
several men, killing four, and rushed at the Duc
d’Orléans, who fled for his life and escaped. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Duke of Burgundy rode up exclaiming, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Haro! le
grand meschef! monseigneur est tout dévoyé!</i>” They
tried to catch the King, but it was most difficult and
dangerous. However, at last a cavalier who was very
fond of him got behind him and threw his arms round
him. He was laid on the ground, the paroxysm
passed off and he fell back insensible. They placed
him in a litter, and the whole troop turned back to
Le Mans. The expedition was at an end, and the
King was mad.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> consternation of everybody and the confusion
into which the kingdom fell can scarcely
be imagined. The King was taken to Creil where he
slowly improved, but was by no means fit to have
anything to do with affairs; indeed for some time he
only had partially lucid intervals, and was altogether
much weakened.</p>

<p>The Queen was on the eve of her confinement, so
the news of what had happened was obliged to be
kept from her, in fact it was forbidden to be told her
on pain of death.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> The Duke of Burgundy seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the government,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> to which he had no right, the
Duc de Berry being his elder brother, and the Duc
d’Orléans the nearest in blood to the King. But, as
Sismondi remarks, the Duke of Burgundy was the
least incapable of the three, and the people, who hated
them all, made no opposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1392}</div>

<p>The Duchess of Burgundy established herself with
the Queen on pretence of taking care of her, and
remained there, dictating, meddling, and taking
precedence of every one. A daughter was born to
the Queen very soon afterwards, and as an offering
for the restoration of the King, Isabeau, when she
heard of the calamity, named the child Marie and
dedicated her to religion.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the court was in a ferment. The King’s
uncles, directly they got the power into their own
hands, began to persecute those of the party opposed
to them.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The Duchess of Burgundy, furious against
Clisson for causing the King to go to war with the
Duc de Bretagne, who was her cousin and great
friend, incited her husband against him. Clisson fled
from the country, so did several others, including the
Seigneur de Noviant who had incurred the enmity
of the Duke of Burgundy by refusing to give him
thirty thousand crowns out of the treasury without
the King’s knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> He and Bureau de la Rivière,
who had been a most intimate friend of Charles V.,
were caught, thrown into the Bastille, and condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
to death. But, fortunately for the latter, the little
Duchesse de Berry, whose marriage he had arranged,
and whom he had himself fetched from the castle of
Gaston de Foix, had ever since that time been exceedingly
fond of him. When she heard that he was
arrested and in danger of his life, with the Duke and
Duchess of Burgundy resolved on his destruction, the
Queen absolutely indifferent, and the King powerless
to help him, she resolved to save him herself. She
was then about fifteen years old, and she hurried to
the Duc de Berry, threw herself on her knees before
him crying and declaring that La Rivière was falsely
accused, that no one dared speak for him but herself,
that he had made her marriage, for which she was
much obliged to him, that the duke ought to feel the
same, that it would be the deepest ingratitude to
desert him to whom they owed their happiness, and
that if he were put to death she would never be
happy again, but would spend every day “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en tristesse
et douleur</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> The Duke, who adored her, comforted
her and promised that his life should be spared. He
went to the King who, though not recovered, was in
a state sufficiently rational to be made to understand
and give a command, and got from him the order for
his pardon, in which the Seigneur de Noviant shared.
They were exiled, but later on the Duchesse de
Berry, of whom the King was very fond, got all their
castles restored to them.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> The Duke and Duchess of
Burgundy were furious, but they could do nothing.</p>

<p>The Seigneur de Coucy had a celebrated doctor, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
certain Guillaume de Hassely,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> who at his recommendation
was called in to the King, and so skilful
was his treatment that Charles gradually improved,
slept, ate, and drank as usual, went out hunting and
hawking, and at last asked for the Queen and Dauphin,
who were brought to him at Creil, where he received
them with delight and affection. He was horrified to
find he had killed and wounded several of his followers
in his paroxysm. After a little he was allowed to see
his brother and uncles, to whom Dr. Hassely said,
“Thank God I restore you the King in good health;
but he must not be irritated, worried, or troubled with
state affairs. His head is not strong yet, but it will
get stronger; meanwhile amusements and distractions
are better for him than councils and work.” The
Queen and Princes were anxious to keep Dr. Hassely
at court, but he was an old man and could not bear
the fatigue of that life. He retired to Laon, covered
with honours and rewards, and died soon afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>The King’s uncles were very glad to persuade him
that he was not well enough to do anything but
amuse himself and had better leave the government
in their hands. Charles inquired for various friends
of his, and was told that they were traitors and in
prison. He ordered them to be at once set free and
their property restored, but had not strength and
clearness of understanding to go more into the
matter, and they were safer away from Paris. He
sent after Clisson and tried to get him to return; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the Constable knew well enough that if the King
had another attack he would fall into the hands of
the Duke of Burgundy again, so he stayed away,
keeping in communication with the Duc d’Orléans
and his party, who were called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Marmousets</i>” by the
friends of the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry. Charles
did not think about business at all; but only amused
himself; and Isabeau, careless, apathetic, indifferent
to everything but dress, luxury, pleasure, and amassing
riches, for some time submitted to the domineering
influence of the Duchess of Burgundy, which was
vehemently resisted by the Duke and Duchess
d’Orléans. Louis claimed the regency during the
King’s incapacity to govern, and Valentine was
indignant at the presumption of the Duchess of
Burgundy in taking precedence over her, the wife of
the King’s only brother and, as she imprudently
remarked, possibly the future Queen of France.</p>

<p>The King was declared to be well again the
following winter; he and the Queen came back and
took up their abode at St. Paul, and the Court was
once more in a whirl of gaiety.</p>

<p>There are various records of purchases made by
Isabeau about this time; amongst others a gold
goblet in the form of a rose, her favourite flower;
pearls to ornament the collar of the Queen’s squirrel,
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chaise à pignier</i> or chair to have her hair dressed in,
having a low back. Most chairs of that time had
very high backs; they were made low for that purpose.
Also some shoes for the Queen’s fool and her
mother. And soon after it is stated that the Queen
not having obtained money enough for divers things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
necessary and desired by her, would in future have
her own “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">argentier</i>” for herself and her children, by
order of the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1393}</div>

<p>It was January, 1393. The King, delighted to be
well again and eager to catch at any new prospect of
amusement, was told by one of the gentlemen of his
household named De Gensay, of a disguise he had
planned whereby people were made to look like
naked savages or wild men covered with long hair
like that of wild beasts, which Paradin remarks was
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chose plaisante à veoir</i>.” These costumes were made
of linen covered all over with tow, very long and
combed out to look like hair from head to foot.
They fitted tightly to the figure, and were stuck on
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fort proprement</i>,” as Paradin again remarks. De
Gensay proposed that the masquerade should take
place at the wedding festivities of one of the Queen’s
ladies, who was a countrywoman and great favourite
of hers. Now this lady had been married before,
and at that time in France extreme licence was
permitted at the re-marriage of a widow.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Speeches,
songs, dances, and general behaviour were alike improper
to a degree that, even in those days, would
not have been allowed on other occasions. The ball
was to take place at a large house which belonged to
Queen Blanche de Navarre. It stood at the corner
of the rue de la Reine Blanche, and was called hôtel
de la Reine Blanche.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> When the King saw this preposterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
disguise he was so delighted that he insisted
on being one of the six who were to wear it, the
others being the Comte de Joüy, the écuyer d’honneur
de Gensay, the bastard De Foix, and the sons of
the Comte de Valentinois and Seigneur de
Nantoillet.</p>

<p>They all begged the King to give orders that at
the ball at which they were to appear no light of any
kind should be allowed to approach them on account
of the inflammable nature of these absurd costumes.
Charles accordingly sent a proclamation ordering all
lights, torches, and flambeaux to retire behind and
far from six savage men who were to enter the saloon
where the ladies were. Unfortunately the Duc
d’Orléans had not been told of the intended
masquerade, of which indeed no one knew but those
who were to take part in it, those who dressed them,
and the Queen. The Duc d’Orléans arrived at the
ball after the proclamation about the lights, and just
then the six savages entered the room all fastened
together with cords except the King, who led them.
The novelty of this ridiculous spectacle was so
successful that everybody crowded round to see them
and try to find out who they were, and in their
excitement forgot all about the order respecting the
lights. The King left his companions fastened
together, and, passing before the Queen, went up to
the young Duchesse de Berry and began to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
love to her (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">luy faisant infinies caresses</i>). She caught
hold of his hand, saying that she would not let him
go until she knew who he was. Just at that moment
the Duc d’Orléans, also desiring to find out who the
mummers were, snatched a torch from one of his
pages and held it down close to them so as to see
better&mdash;the dry tow caught fire, in a moment they
were all in flames and being fastened together, they
could neither escape nor could any one help them.
The Duchesse de Berry, when she saw the whole
place on fire, threw her long robe round the King
and so saved him. The Queen, seeing the flames,
hearing the dreadful cries and tumult, and knowing
that the King was one of the six, fell fainting with
terror. The young De Nantoillet managed to unfasten
himself from the others, and happening to
remember a tank or cistern of water in one of the
rooms of service close by, used for washing the plate,
rushed into that room, threw himself into the tank,
and was saved; of the rest, De Gensay (the inventor
of the mummery) and Charles de Poitiers, son of the
Comte de Valentinois, were burnt to death on the
spot, and the other two only survived their injuries
for two days. There was a general cry of “Save the
King!” but the Duchesse de Berry, hastily exclaiming,
“Go and change your clothes at once, the Queen is in
terror about you,” had hurried him out of the ballroom.
Isabeau was carried fainting to her room, where
Charles, having pulled off the fatal disguise, hastened
to reassure her. Every one was accusing and blaming
the Duc d’Orléans, who, nearly beside himself with
horror and remorse, and crying out that he had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
it and it was all his fault, fled out of the ballroom and
rushed up to the apartments of the King and Queen.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>The Dukes of Burgundy and Berry had left the
ball before the arrival of the mummers, finding it
rather late, and had returned to their own hôtels.
They knew nothing about what had happened until
the next morning, when there was a great outcry all
over Paris, and the report reached their ears that
there had been a great fire after they had left the ball
and that the King had been burnt to death with the
others. Even after they had ascertained the truth
the people would not believe it, but insisted on seeing
the King for themselves, and it was not until he had
gone in public procession with his brother and uncles
to Notre Dame to give thanks for his safety, that
they were pacified; and when they found out in
what an idiotic way the King’s life had nearly
been sacrificed they broke into denunciations of the
goings on at court and threats against the princes of
the blood. Some people even declared that Louis
d’Orléans had done it on purpose, hoping to destroy
the King and thus have the chance of succeeding
himself if the Dauphin, who was delicate, did not live
to grow up; which, by the by, would certainly have
come to pass, for he died before he was ten years old.
But there is not the slightest proof or even probability
of the truth of this accusation. With all his faults
Louis was not capable of so monstrous a crime as
this, even supposing he had not been, as he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
appears to have been, on affectionate terms with his
brother.</p>

<p>The catastrophe excited the greatest horror in the
minds of everybody except the tenants and people
belonging to the Comte de Joüy, who was so outrageously
tyrannical and cruel that they were all
delighted when they heard that they were so unexpectedly
delivered from him.</p>

<p>The late calamity seems to have had a sobering
effect upon the court, and for a little while after this
shock things went on more quietly. But in June the
King had a relapse, and this time he was worse, or at
any rate the aggravated symptoms lasted longer.
He did not recognise the Queen, and when she came
near and spoke to him affectionately would ask who
she was and even seemed to take a dislike to her, and
told those surrounding him to take her away for he
did not know what she wanted. He declared that he
was not King, that his name was not Charles but
George, that his arms were a lion pierced with a spear
and not the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i>, the very sight of which threw
him into a rage, and which he would try to efface or
tear out of tapestries, plate, or anything upon which
they were. He declared he was not married and had
no children, and the only person he knew was the
Duchesse d’Orléans whom he insisted on seeing every
day, and called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma sœur bien-aimée</i>.” People began,
as usual, to talk about sorcery. Some said it was to
witchcraft that Valentine owed her influence, others
declared that the King’s illness came from his having
been bewitched. Dr. Hassely was dead, and the
Queen insisted on sending for a sorcerer to try and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
cure him. The sorcerer or wizard was, as the monk
of St. Denis says, “coarse, brutal, and vulgar.” He
had a magic book, which he said God had given to
Adam, and by which he professed to be able to
control the stars, so that if any planet had a malign
influence on the King he could cause another to
appear to counteract it. All the clergy, doctors, and
professors were very angry and the sorcerer did no
good; some said it was folly, others, that it was sin;
there was a great outcry and he was got rid of. Then
a learned doctor called Fréron was called in, under
whom Charles began to get better. All over the
kingdom they had litanies, prayers, and processions
followed by crowds of barefooted people; priests in
splendid robes going from one church to another.
The King said he would go too, and after persisting
several times, he went to St. Denis with a great
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> of nobles, heard mass, where he behaved very
well, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d’une manière décente et sans commettre aucune
extravagance</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> After dinner he went away, leaving
the Bishop of Senlis to make a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">neuvaine</i> for him.
The Queen ordered them at many churches. In
January, 1394, he was well again. Early in the same
month the Princess Michelle was born.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1394}</div>

<p>In honour of her the King changed into “Porte Ste.
Michelle” the name of the “Porte de l’Enfer” so
called on account of the haunted convent of the
Chartreux of Vauvert just outside it, with its weird
tales of moving lights, unearthly sounds, and
phantoms, spoken of in the former volume treating of
the Valois Queens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
The Hundred Years’ War with England still dragged
on, and brigands again began to infest the country,
and great distress prevailed; to the alleviation of
which Charles now turned his attention for a short
time. For Dr. Fréron, either finding that the treatment
ordered by his predecessor had been carried
much too far, or else because he thought quiet, and
rational occupation with the affairs of the State would
do the King more good than the ceaseless, reckless,
dissipation,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> which was the original cause of his
illness, ordered him a tranquil life, occupation for
his mind, rest, and various other changes which
certainly appeared to succeed; for the King was
quite restored under his care, and as well as he
had been before his first seizure. No one could now
say that he was not capable of giving proper orders,
nor dispute the validity of those he gave, as the Duke
of Burgundy had done when the King had granted
some permissions to hunt in the royal forests.</p>

<p>Charles went several pilgrimages and, his own
sufferings having made him more compassionate to
others, he recalled fugitives chased away by the
tyranny of his uncles, exempted them from taxation
for six years, and, abolishing the games of chance in
the villages, he established practice in shooting with
the bow and crossbow, in order that the peasants
should be able to help defend the country which now
was obliged to hire mercenaries to oppose the English
archers. The people were delighted at this, and
already, says M. Sismondi, becoming so skilful that
the nobles in alarm took the first opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
putting a stop to the archery and re-opening the
gambling houses. The remembrance of the Jacquerie
was naturally in the minds of the French gentlemen
as was that of their tyranny in the hearts of the
people. That unfortunate class hatred between the
upper and lower ranks which, as was remarked in our
former volume, had caused the disgrace and downfall
of France, was still growing and establishing itself
as time passed on, while other nations were slowly
becoming stronger and more closely united to their
own countrymen as they advanced in civilisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1395}</div>

<p>The King went on very well until about the middle
of the summer of 1395, by which time he had grown
very tired of the restraints imposed on him by Dr.
Fréron, the trouble of attending to serious affairs,
and the comparative dulness of his court. Also it is
probable that the symptoms of the terrible malady so
long kept at bay by the skill of the great doctor were
making themselves felt and deprived him of the little
self-control and sense he had ever had. At any rate
he dismissed Dr. Fréron, who retired with his property
to Cambrai,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and when he had gone the frenzy
returned and Charles was again mad.</p>

<p>It had been a bad summer, with violent winds,
doing much damage. Misfortunes and troubles
seemed to be gathering again over France. The
deepest disappointment was felt by high and low at
the relapse of the King, confusion and misgovernment
began again, the air was full of evil rumours
and terrors as it had been in the years before the
battles of Crécy and Poitiers. It was reported that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
in Languedoc had been seen a great star, followed by
five little ones which seemed to attack it for about
the space of half an hour, while voices and dreadful
cries were heard in the heavens; and there appeared
the gigantic form of a man who shone like copper,
transfixed the great star with a spear and vanished.</p>

<p>In Guyenne unearthly voices were heard in the air,
accompanied by the clang of armour and the tramp
of combatants.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>The court was rent by the quarrels of the Queen
and Duchesse d’Orléans with the Duchess of
Burgundy, whom neither of them could bear, and
whose interference Isabeau was now roused up to
resist. In fact, the arrogance and encroachments of
the Burgundian party had become alike intolerable
and alarming. The state of the King from this time
grew gradually worse. He was not always mad, but
his attacks grew more frequent, lasted longer, and
took different forms on different occasions. Sometimes
even in the middle of them he would have
lucid intervals in which his commands were absolutely
obeyed. After a period of sanity and health, he
could tell by the symptoms when the attack was
coming on again, and would desire that all arms,
knives, &amp;c., should be taken out of his reach, and
sometimes that he should be forcibly restrained lest
he should hurt any one. He begged every one he
knew, if they had bewitched him, as some said, to
have pity upon him and reverse the spell. The whole
state of things was heartbreaking, and when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
mad he did not know the Queen, it was not safe for
her to go near him, he struck at her and ran after her
so that she fled in terror. Sometimes he knew every
one except the Queen and her children, but one
person he always knew, and that was the Duchesse
d’Orléans.</p>

<p>He was always calling for her. She would go to
him without the least fear and sit with him for hours.
Her voice seemed to have a strange fascination for
him, and he would do anything she wished. There is
not the slightest idea that between Charles and Valentine
there was ever any such love as between Louis
and Isabeau, but they had always been fond of each
other as brother and sister. The populace, however,
chose to attribute her influence to magic; they said
she came from Lombardy, where it was practised
to a great extent; that her father himself was a
magician, and that it was from no devotional reasons
that the Duc d’Orléans went so often to the Céléstins,
but to see one of the brotherhood, a certain Philippe
de Mezière, looked upon with suspicion on account
of his studies, who had been a great friend of the late
King. Louis d’Orléans would sit up half the night
talking with him about books, music, or metaphysical
subjects. He was a strange mixture of the most
opposite qualities and vices, and he added to the
inconsistencies of his character that of being extremely
devotional. In all intellectual tastes he
and Valentine suited each other very well; as to
Isabeau, she knew nothing about such matters.
There is a record of an historical manuscript which
the Duke of Burgundy gave her, probably with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
hope of inducing her to take more interest in literary
subjects, but it was of no use.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The injurious reports concerning Louis and Valentine
were diligently circulated by the Burgundian
party. She was said, and by many believed, to have
bewitched the King. The monk of St. Denis remarks,
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pour moi, je mis loin de partager l’opinion
vulgaire au sujet des sortilèges, opinion repandue par
les sots, les nécromanciers, et les gens superstitieux; les
médecins et les théologiens s’accordent à dire que les
maléfices n’ont aucune puissance, et que la maladie du
roi provenait des excés de sa jeunesse.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>Things, however, came to a climax at last when
Valentine was accused of attempting to poison the
Dauphin in order to open the way to the throne for
her husband and children. The story was that one
day when the children of the King and the Duc
d’Orléans were playing together in the apartments
of Valentine some one had thrown an apple amongst
them close to the Dauphin, who was about to pick it
up, but that one of the children of the Duc d’Orléans
got it, bit a piece out, was taken ill, and died in a few
days, the apple being poisoned. The only thing that
is certainly true about this story is that a little son
of Louis and Valentine did die about this time; but
whether he ate an apple shortly before his death,
whether it was thrown among the children when at
play, or whether there was any reason for attributing
his death to such a cause does not seem to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
shown. It does not appear that there was a shadow
of probability about it, but that it was nothing more
than a spiteful calumny got up by the Burgundian
party and believed by the fierce and credulous
Parisian mob. However, there was a great outcry:
the Dauphin was not allowed to go to the apartments
of the Duchesse d’Orléans, and the Duc
d’Orléans and his friends thought Valentine would
be safer out of Paris for the present. Therefore she
left that city with her children in great pomp for
Blois, where she remained for a time till the storm
blew over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1396}</div>

<p>Her father, the Duke of Milan, was furious when
he heard of these accusations against his daughter
and himself, for he was also said to have bewitched
the King, to have asked the French ambassador how
he was, and on being told “well,” to have exclaimed,
“You tell me a diabolic thing, and one that is impossible.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
The King cannot be well”&mdash;clearly pointing
either to sorcery or secret poisoning. He offered to
send a champion to fight to the death any man
who accused his daughter, and threatened to invade
France.</p>

<p>In January, 1396, the Queen gave birth to a son,
who was named Louis, and in February the King
recovered his senses. It had been arranged that the
little Princess Isabella, eldest daughter of Charles
and Isabeau, should be married to Richard II., King
of England, instead of to the son of the Duc de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Bretagne, to whom she had at first been betrothed.
Richard was thirty years old and a widower, but it
was felt that the splendour and advantages of such
an alliance as this, not only for the Princess, but still
more for France, were not to be lost. The English
ambassadors, therefore, when in 1395 they came to
Paris, where the King was at that time living at the
Louvre, and the Queen and her children at the hôtel
St. Paul, were received with great honour and favour,
and having paid their respects to the Queen, they
turned to the Princess Isabelle. The Marshal of
England knelt before her saying, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Madame, s’il plaît
à Dieu, vous serez notre dame et Reine d’Angleterre.</i>”
To which the pretty, graceful child, who was only
about seven years old, replied, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sire s’il plaît à Dieu
et à monseigneur mon père, je le serai volontiers; car
on m’a bien dit que je serais une grande dame.</i>” Then
giving him her hand she raised him and led him to
her mother.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1397}</div>

<p>The ambassadors were enchanted with the little
princess, who was the especial darling of her parents
and the whole Court. All the daughters of Charles
and Isabeau seem to have been remarkable for good
looks and charm, and very superior to their sons.
The second one, Jeanne, was promised to the son of
the Duc de Bretagne instead, and the marriage of
Isabelle took place in October, 1397.</p>

<p>Magnificent preparations were of course made beforehand
for the wedding of the eldest daughter of the
Valois with the great enemy of her country, by which it
was hoped to close the Hundred Years’ War and restore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
prosperity to France. The King sent for the most
skilful jewellers and ordered for her a profusion of
rings, bracelets, necklaces, chains, and all kinds of
jewels of great price, cloth of gold and other costly
stuffs, covered chariots, saddles and bridles covered
with gold and silver. He was fortunately quite well,
and sane just then, so that he was able to attend
his daughter’s wedding. He went with the Queen,
princes, and court to meet the King of England
between Calais and Ardres, where the French and
English camps were pitched near each other, the
French one containing a hundred and twenty tents
surrounded by a palisade, and in front a large tent
like a great hall, more magnificent than the rest,
over which floated the lilies of France.</p>

<p>The English camp contained the same number of
tents, but the one that stood in front of it, with the
standard bearing the leopards of England, was like a
vast round tower.</p>

<p>The most stringent regulations were proclaimed in
both camps to avoid the slightest danger of any
disputes arising to endanger the harmony of the
meeting on which hung the peace and welfare of
two kingdoms.</p>

<p>None but the immediate escorts were to be armed;
it was forbidden to throw stones, pick quarrels, or
play any game that could lead to them, and the conferences
went on amicably for several days, being
disturbed only by a violent storm which tore up
many tents in the French camp, tearing the silk
lining of them to shreds, while only four of the
English tents suffered. Torrents of rain fell, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
superstitious fears were entertained that some
calamity was about to happen. “But,” says the
worthy chronicler of St. Denis, “on learning the
result of the conference, they rather thought the
enemy of the repose of mankind who dwells among
the shades of darkness had thus given vent to his
fury because he had not been able to throw any
obstacle in the way of peace.”<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>The young Queen, who had been married by proxy
to Richard in Paris, set off for St. Denis with great
pomp, where she performed her devotions according
to the ancient custom, and then continued her journey.</p>

<p>The King of England had been dining with the
King of France, waited upon by the Dukes of Burgundy,
Berry, and Bourbon, both monarchs having
been much entertained by the amusing conversation
of the last-mentioned prince, when the sound of
trumpets and other music announced the approach
of the young Queen of England, who entered the
camp with a procession of surpassing magnificence,
wearing royal robes covered with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>, a
gentleman of her train carrying a crown of gold
before her carriage. The Duchesses of Lancaster
and Gloucester came forward to pay their homage,
and the Dukes of Burgundy, Berry, and Orléans
advanced, and one of them taking her in his arms
carried her to her father, who led her by the hand to
the King of England, saying, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon fils, voici ma fille
que je vous avais promise, je vous la laisse, en vous
priant de l’aimer désormais comme votre femme.</i>”
Richard II. was a most imposing personage. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the stately bearing of the Plantagenets he united
the far-famed beauty of his mother, the Fair Maid
of Kent. As the little Queen bent before him he
raised her up and kissed her, after which he took his
leave.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> She was placed in a splendid litter in which
she was to proceed to her husband’s town of Calais,
accompanied by the Duchesses of Lancaster, York,
Gloucester, and other great English ladies, with the
Dame de Coucy, who was to go with her to England.
She began to cry and sob at parting from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
father and uncles; Charles VI., who was extremely
fond of her, cried too, and the Dukes also shed tears.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>
The King and Queen were married again at the
Church of St. Nicolas at Calais, and the day after
that embarked for England. Before going on board
ship, finding that her French attendants were to be
dismissed, the poor little thing began to cry again,
and begged King Richard to let them go with her,
to which he at once consented, so they accompanied
her to England.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>An expedition had been for some time in preparation
to assist Sigismond, King of Hungary, against
the Turks under Bajazet, who had invaded Europe
and threatened to push on to Rome and feed his
horse upon the high altar of St. Peter. The troop
consisted of a thousand men, amongst whom were
many young cavaliers of the noblest houses in France,
led by Jean, Comte de Nevers, eldest son of the Duke
of Burgundy, then about twenty-two years old. The
troop was splendidly equipped, Philippe of Burgundy
having by means of heavy taxes on his vassals collected
a great sum of money with which, had he
spent it rationally, he could have put an army into
the field. The troop had set forth in March, and
the luxury and extravagance of the French nobles
astonished their Hungarian and German allies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Their tents were of green satin, their banners and
the trappings of their horses were covered with gold
and silver, their armour, dresses, and plate were
magnificent. They marched across Germany and
joined their allies at Buda-Pesth. The army then
marched along the banks of the Danube, upon which
great barges accompanied them loaded with choice
wines and delicacies for the French.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>But evil rumours began to be afloat after some
time regarding the expedition, and the chroniclers
of the time relate various supernatural occurrences
which filled with terror the superstitious minds of
the people. The garrisons of various fortresses in
Guyenne were awakened in the night by the clash
of arms. Fearing a surprise, they seized their weapons,
and beheld a battle fought in the air by phantoms in
the forms of cavaliers in armour, which filled them
with dread. They sent messengers to inform the
King, the court, and the university of these prodigies,
which seemed to portend divers calamities.
“For my part,” remarks the monk of St. Denis, “I
leave the secret of all these supernatural events to
Him who knows all and who commands the heavens,
the earth, and the sea.”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>But on Christmas night, 1396, when the King and
all the court were assembled in the hôtel St. Paul,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>
one Jacques de Helly entered the hall in boots, spurs,
and all the disorder of a hasty journey, and throwing
himself on his knees before the King, told him of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
disastrous defeat of the French by Bajazet and the
massacre or captivity of the whole troop. It appeared
that the French, furious at being obliged to raise
the siege of Nicopolis, had murdered in cold blood
and in violation of their plighted word all their
prisoners who had surrendered on parole, and that
Bajazet, enraged at their treachery, had naturally
retaliated, and having by overwhelming numbers
defeated them and killed four hundred, had taken
prisoners the Comte de Nevers and about three
hundred others. He had ordered them all to be
beheaded except twenty-eight of the highest rank,
for whom he could exact enormous ransoms, and
among whom of course was the Comte de Nevers.
It was to obtain these ransoms, that Jacques de
Helly had been sent. It then appeared that some
unfortunate fugitives had already come with the
tidings, but had been shut up in the Châtelet to
prevent the news being disclosed, with threats of
being drowned if they told it. History certainly
repeats itself.</p>

<p>However, no amount of lies would now avail to
make the Parisians think a defeat was a victory,
besides which it was necessary again to wring money
from the people to pay the ransoms.</p>

<p>This misfortune had such an effect upon the King,
that instead of his being all right until the summer as
before, an attack of madness came on early in the
spring, to cure which Marshal de Sancerre sent from
Languedoc two Augustine monks, who had the
reputation of being magicians. This was, of course,
in direct opposition to the rules of the Church, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
the clergy did not exactly like to prevent their
endeavours; they contented themselves with murmuring
that it would be much better to burn them as
wizards than to offer them rewards. In July the
King recovered his reason, for which the monks
imprudently took the credit, forgetting what would
be likely to befall them should he have a relapse.</p>

<p>The second daughter of Charles and Isabeau, the
Princess Jeanne, was married to
the son of the Duc de Bretagne;
and the third, the Princess Marie,
who had been dedicated from her
infancy to the religious life, was
now received into the convent of
Poissy.</p>

<div id="illo_11" class="figright" style="width: 197px;">
  <img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="197" height="350" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE PRIORESS OF POISSY.</div></div>

<p>On the day of the Nativity of
the Virgin, the King and Queen,
with a brilliant company, arrived
at Poissy. There was a grand
procession, the Bishop of Bayeux
bearing a splendid jewel presented
by the King, who with
the Queen and a brilliant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i>
of nobles and ladies formed part of the procession, the
Sire d’Albret carrying in his arms the Princess Marie,
who wore a gold crown and long robe and mantle of
cloth of gold, and whom he placed before the chapter,
where the spiritual director of the convent addressed
the novice, who, it must be remembered, was not yet
five years old, and explained to her the rules of the
order and the vow of poverty, chastity, and obedience,
to which the child “answered humbly that she submitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
herself.” The Prioress, who was a sister of
the Duc de Bourbon, and had taken the veil at this
convent at about the age of the Princess Marie, then
dressed her in the habit of the order, after which she
was conducted to the church by all the nuns, singing
hymns to the Holy Spirit. After mass she received
the episcopal benediction, and then there was a
splendid banquet given by the King. At the close
of the proceedings a dispute arose between the
Prioress and the Abbot and monks of St. Denis
respecting the crown worn by the little princess
which was of gold set with jewels of great price, and
which, with the robes, jewels, &amp;c., worn by her, the
Prioress claimed according, as she said, to the usual
custom, for the convent. But it appeared that this
crown belonged to the abbey of St. Denis, and had
been only lent for the occasion; therefore the monks
would by no means give it up. The King, being
appealed to, declared the crown had been borrowed
by his orders, and settled the matter by paying the
convent 600 gold crowns to redeem it, and sending it
back to St. Denis.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1398}</div>

<p>The King and Queen arranged the household of
the young princess, appointing certain nuns to be her
ladies, and then returned to Paris.</p>

fewer lucid intervals, during one of which, however,
he went to Reims and entertained with lavish
hospitality the Emperor Wenceslas. The two monks
were still at the Bastille occupied with their necromancy,
but as it had no effect upon the King, who
had more attacks than ever this year, the terror they
inspired began to diminish, while the horror excited
by their supposed dealings with the powers of darkness
remained. Seeing the danger of their position
they tried to propitiate the Duke of Burgundy
by laying the blame of their failure on the Duc
d’Orléans, saying that the diabolic arts he employed
against the King were too strong for them to counteract.
But by this outrageous accusation against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
King’s brother, they had gone too far. The Duc
d’Orléans complained, the monks were arrested and
given over to the clergy, who delivered them to the
provost of Paris, and they were soon afterwards
beheaded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1398}</div>

<p>In August another son was born to the King and
Queen and named Jean.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>In October died Queen Blanche de Navarre, alike
beloved and honoured by the royal family, the court,
and the people. The adventures of her brilliant
youth when she shared the throne of Philippe de
Valois, or the fortunes of her brothers, the gallant
Princes of Navarre, have been related in a former
volume. She had always been rich and powerful,
but never through oppressing her subjects or vassals,
so that they loved and venerated her as a mother.
She was the providence of the poor and suffering,
and a good friend to the religious houses. With
every earthly gift and advantage, brilliant beauty, an
irresistible fascination, distinguished talents, high
rank and great riches, living in the midst of the most
dissipated court in Europe, no taint of dishonour ever
sullied her name; she seemed, in the midst of all the
cruelty, violence, and corruption with which she was
surrounded, like a bright star in a dark and stormy
sky. For fifty years she had been Queen-dowager,
and she had been present certainly at the marriage of
the eldest, and almost certainly at the marriage of the
second, and the consecration of the third of the great-great-granddaughters
of her husband. Her dowry
reverted to the crown, her personal property, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
was large, she divided between her favourite nephew,
Pierre de Navarre, and certain charities. But as to
the relic she left to the Carmelite Church, the worthy
monk of St. Denis earnestly declares that she “was
deceived by vain and lying tongues of those who
brought it from Constantinople, for the only true and
undoubted nail which pierced our Lord belongs to
St. Denis and nowhere else, as is proved by the
history of Charlemagne and by continued miracles
which for five hundred years have been done by
contact of that relic.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>The officers of her household went to ask the Dukes
of Burgundy, Berry, and Orléans whether, not having
been crowned Queen, her funeral was to be at St.
Denis with royal pomp. To which (the King being
probably ill then) they replied at once that it was
undoubtedly to be so, and it was attended by all the
royal family and court.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>The health of the King gradually grew worse.
The attacks came oftener and lasted longer. But
whenever they subsided, as they often did quite
suddenly, he became sane again, resumed the government,
went out hunting and hawking, and took part
in everything, whether amusement or business, as
usual. During his intervals of insanity, the Queen
ought of course to have been a most important part
of the government, but she cared nothing about that
or any rational thing; what interested her were only
the dissipations of the court, her dress, the sums of
money and treasure she could collect, eating and
drinking, and the constant society of Louis d’Orléans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
The only praiseworthy or harmless tastes she had
were a sort of natural affection for her children
and a fondness for animals of which she had a
good many for pets. She was also fond of music.
Amongst the accounts of the period we find sums
paid to the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">varlet de chambre</i>” of Madame Michelle
de France for having, during her absence at Poissy
(probably to attend the consecration of her little
sister) mended her gold cup which the monkey had
broken; to Guillaume Juvel “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">varlet de chambre de
la royne</i>,” for money lent the Queen to give a poor
man who had given her a goldfinch that would eat
out of her hand; also for a milch cow for Monseigneur
Jehan de France and for a tent for him with
tapestries with histories on them; for the harpist of
the Queen and the minstrels of the Dauphin; and for
a large box of wood and iron with holes in it to burn
a candle by night in the room of Madame Jehanne
de France. Among the same accounts come splendid
clothes for the Queen’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">relevailles</i> on getting up after
her confinement; baths of oak; sums for putting iron
on two large cupboards in the Queen’s stables at St.
Paul to keep the harness of pearls and embroidery of
her horses; for two pair of wheels for her “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">char</i>”; for
mending some tapestries bearing the histories of nine
heroes, that is to say, Joshua, David, Judas Maccabeus,
Hector, Alexander, Cæsar, Arthur, Charlemagne, and
Godefroi de Bouillon; histories of the seven deadly
sins, of the seven ages of man; of Godefroi de
Bouillon, of the Dukes of Aquitaine; and the history
of stags.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1399}</div>

<p>And for making a chair of red Cordova leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
fringed with silk, gilt nails, and two gold chains,
decorated and painted with choice colours.</p>

<p>Isabeau had much more idea of comfort than had
hitherto been usual even in the palaces of the Kings
of France. Mingled with the splendour that had
been more or less customary for some generations we
see various attempts at convenience not yet introduced.
She is said to have been the first to use a
“suspended carriage,” and those she had were
luxurious and commodious to a degree never seen
before, and drawn by very swift horses. She had one
chariot on purpose for thunderstorms, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour le
tonnerre</i>,” but in what the safety of it consisted is not
stated.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>She had <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calorifères</i> like little iron chariots filled
with red-hot ashes wheeled about the cold galleries
of the palaces, and hollow balls of gold and silver
full of red-hot cinders to hold in the hand as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chaufferettes</i>.
In hot weather she caused herself to be fanned
by huge fans to keep her cool and drive away the
flies; her rooms were hung with costly tapestry and
stuffs which were taken down and went with her
from one palace to another. She had one room
entirely hung with white satin, another with green
satin, and her plate was almost always of gold. She
used an Eastern talisman against poison, fastened
with a silver gilt chain to her goblet and salt-cellar,
and an officer of her household tried every dish
before she tasted it. She had a cupboard painted
and decorated by a skilful artist, in which she kept
her relics and perfumes. For the latter she had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
mania. She always kept damask rose water about
her, and used also a great quantity of what were
called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">oiselets de Chypre</i>.” These were little bottles
something the shape of birds, filled with different
Oriental perfumes. She and her ladies were constantly
eating all sorts of sweetmeats, of which there
seem to have been innumerable kinds.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

  <div class="caption">BEDROOM OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</div></div>

<p>Carpets were sometimes, but not generally used,
the floors were still strewn with rushes and fresh
boughs, especially the great halls and banqueting
rooms. It was, however, usual to lay them on the
steps going up to the great beds, and the floors of
many of the rooms in the palaces were of wood, often
inlaid.</p>

<p>They must have looked both magnificent and
comfortable, those great bedrooms in the palaces
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hôtels</i> of the nobles. The huge bed in an alcove
or corner, steps covered with rich carpets going up to
it, and curtains of silk or some costly material, carved
cupboards, chests and seats, beams of the ceilings
painted or gilded, walls hung with tapestry, windows
protected by trellises of iron and filled with stained
glass, a huge chimney-place, sculptured all over with
figures and armorial bearings, on the hearth of which
blazed great logs, while by it at right angles a tall
carved settle kept away the draught.</p>

<p>The Queen’s bath was of carved oak, furnished or
lined with bath sheets or towels. Over it was a
canopy with curtains, which drew all round.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>One thing appears to be certain, and that is that,
although at this time houses were insanitary and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
streets narrow and dirty, with open sewers in them,
people were personally far cleaner than at a later
day.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> All through the Valois times, down to 1600,
there were plenty of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">étuves</i>, or public bath-houses,
to which every one who had not baths in their own
houses used often to go. There were hot and vapour
baths, and some of these establishments were extremely
luxurious and elegant, and were used for
other purposes besides bathing. People who were
starting on a journey often slept at them the night
before, setting off from them in the morning; they
were often much resorted to as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rendezvous</i>, and many
were the scenes of license and revelry which took
place in them when the young nobles and courtiers,
led often by Louis d’Orléans, adjourned there after
some supper or banquet.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>The priests were very angry with them, and often
preached against them, and so, later on, did the
Huguenot ministers. By 1600 they had much
diminished in number and importance, and soon
after they disappeared,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> which was a great pity, for of
course it did no good at all; people were just as
immoral as before, and not nearly so clean. But this
is another instance of the mischief done by the misplaced
activity of those busy, fanatical folks, who,
with the most excellent intentions in their attempts
to reform either religion or morals, direct their attacks
upon something which is in itself perfectly harmless,
or even valuable to the majority of people, doing all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
they can to deprive them of it, simply because they
see some persons make an improper use of it. The
early Christians were always preaching against those
magnificent Roman baths, the destruction of which
was such an irreparable loss to the people.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> The
Puritans, thinking that the morals of many plays
and the lives of many actors left much to be desired,
would, even in the last generation, have done away
with all theatres if they had been allowed. And in
our own days have we not many instances of the
same kind?</p>

<p>In spite of all the suffering she caused and the
harm she did, we do not gather that Isabeau was
at all actively harsh, cruel, or disagreeable. She
seems to have been liked by the companions of her
follies, the servants of her household, and her ladies,
of whom she had four <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dames</i>, four <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demoiselles de corps</i>,
and two others. Her vices, faults, and deficiencies
were just the worst she could have had in the present
crisis, for they made her not only useless, but mischievous.
If she had had brains, decision of character,
courage, and common sense, she might also
have been proud, passionate, vindictive, or ambitious,
to any extent, and yet have been a great queen, and
perhaps the salvation of France.</p>

<p>But Isabeau’s faults were not those of a great
character. She was selfish, lazy, frivolous, vain, and
avaricious. She let the reins of government remain
without an effort or complaint in the hands of the
Duke of Burgundy, she allowed the overbearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
interference of the Duchess until it became perfectly
insupportable. She now occupied herself in amassing
for herself an enormous private fortune, considering
that the health of the King gave every cause
for fear, and that she had had no dowry on her
marriage. She had certainly secured to herself by
letters of the King, 1394, a revenue of 25,000 <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">livres</i>,
representing at that time an enormous sum;<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> but
besides this she was constantly collecting and storing
away in chests, gold, jewels, plate, unset diamonds,
and other precious stones, title deeds of lands, everything
she could lay her hands upon, in which she was
assisted by her brother, Ludwig of Bavaria, who was
constantly in France, getting a large share of the
spoils, wrung by taxation from the people. Isabeau
seems to have had more affection for him than for
any one else, and never appears to have changed
towards him. From what little can be known about
him he must have been very much like her, he was
generally with her and Louis d’Orléans, and the
people hated him, perhaps, most of all. Isabeau
caused him to be <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand maître d’hôtel</i> to the King
for some years, and married him first to Anne de
Bourbon, Comtesse de Montpensier, and then to
Catherine d’Alençon, widow of Pierre de Navarre,
both princesses of the blood. He was apparently
corrupt, dissipated, greedy after money, shallow, and
useless.</p>

  <div class="caption">OLD PARIS.</div></div>

<p>Though the streets of Paris were narrow and
winding, yet both city and faubourgs had many
large gardens and enclosures, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clos</i>, as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
called, which belonged to the abbeys, convents,
palaces, and hotels of the King and nobles. First,
there was the famous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Prè aux clercs</i>, renowned in
romance, mentioned several times in this and a
former volume, which was so large that De Sauval
says: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il se va perdu bien loin dans la campagne</i>,”
and which only began to be built upon in 1630. The
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clos des Jacobins</i> was nine acres, where now are the
streets of la Madeleine, St. Thomas, St. Dominique, &amp;c.,
and it was said that before part of it was cut through
to make the moats and fortifications in the reign of
Jean, it went up to the walls of the university.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clos des Cordeliers</i> was also enormous, and in fact the
great enclosures, gardens, vineyards, meadows, and
even preserves for rabbits and other game, were so
numerous as to form an important feature in the
ancient capital.</p>

<p>For those who care for the history of Paris there
still remain in the byeways antique houses, picturesque
corners, and old streets, around which cling
the historic memories dear to their hearts, but to the
great majority to whom it appears as nothing but an
endless succession of broad streets and boulevards
lined with trees, superb, monotonous, uninteresting
houses copied from the Italian, and splendid shops;
it would be impossible to picture to themselves
mediæval Paris as it existed at the time of which
this book treats.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison, in an interesting essay on the transformation
of Paris, says: “The modern streets, to
which our tourists confine their walks, form after all
only a gigantic screen, behind which much of old
Paris still remains untouched.”</p>

<p>Until 1789 Paris remained a mediæval city. It
would, of course, be out of the question in a work
like this to attempt to give any real account of it,
but it is possible to catch just a glimpse of what the
aspect and life of the city must then have been by
careful researches into the many splendid works in the
Bibliothèque Nationale, the British Museum, and other
places, which are filled with pictures and descriptions
of it.</p>

<p>With its lofty walls, towers, gates, and moats, old
Paris looked, as it was, a fortress. Inside it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
dense, tangled network of dark lanes, narrow,
crooked streets, huge palaces, mediæval fortresses
and conventual enclosures. Here and there came
a tower or Gothic portal, churches, bridges, and
quays crowded with confused piles of lofty wooden
houses, walled gardens with terraces, courts, and
colonnades; while those great royal and feudal
castles, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Châtelet</i>, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bastille</i>, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Temple</i>, and
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Louvre</i>, frowned over the city.</p>

<p>The sanitary state of Paris was such that it is difficult
to understand why any one was left alive. Narrow,
unpaved streets, with open sewers running down the
middle of them, cemeteries and charnel houses in the
heart of the city, drinking water taken direct from
the Seine, it is no wonder that there were such
numbers of deaths of children and young people, and
that so few attained to old age. Of all the children
of Philippe de Valois only two lived to grow up; out
of the numerous family of Charles V. only two
survived their childhood. Charles VI. had twelve
children, and though only four died in childhood,
scarcely one reached forty-five years. The sons and
daughters of King Jean must have been exceptionally
strong, for all except one grew up, and one or two
lived to be quite old. And if this were the case with
the royal family, it was not likely to be better with
those who lived under much less favourable conditions.</p>

<p>Not only within the walls, but for many miles
outside them stood a profusion of churches, convents,
abbeys, chapels, oratories of all sizes, from the mighty
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">St. Germain des Près</i> to the smallest chantry on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
pier of a bridge. Rich in works of art, gorgeous in
colour, paintings, frescoes, mosaics, stained glass, carved
statues, coloured marbles, gold and silver plate, bronzes,
ivories, silks, velvets, tapestries, embroideries, illuminated
books, bells, clocks, perfumes, organs, instruments
of music, choirs of singers, every beautiful
and delightful thing was crowded together with the
relics of saints and tombs of great men, miraculous
images, lamps, candles on thousands of altars, offerings
dedicated to countless saints and martyrs. The
Church was school, art museum, place of instruction,
prayer, confession of sin, preaching, and civilising.
The great convents and monasteries were the schools,
colleges, hospitals and poorhouses. They existed in
design for the poor, diseased, and wretched. Christ
loved the weak and suffering, and the doors of His
house stood ever open to the weak, the suffering, the
halt, the blind, and the lame. The poorest, the
weakest, the most abject, were welcome there. The
priest, the monk, and the nun taught, clothed, and
nursed the suffering poor and their children; there
was consolation in heaven for those who had found
earth a hell.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Strange and characteristic were the names of many
of the streets and houses, such as Cherche-midi,
Trois-morts-et-trois-vifs, L’Ymage-de-Saint Nicolas,
Quatre-fils-Aymon, Ami-du-cœur, Panier-vert, Hospice
des Quinze-Vingts,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> beside the Croissant, Lyon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
d’or, Gerbe d’or, Croix blanche, Homme sauvage,
Couronne, Cheval blanc, and many others still in use.
Isabeau had several hôtels of her own amongst this
tangled labyrinth of streets, buildings, and gardens.
First, the hôtel de la Reine, which was one of the
group of hôtels connected by galleries and colonnades,
surrounded by gardens, built by Charles V., and
called St. Paul. Then she had one in the faubourg
St. Marcel, given her by the Duc de Berry, and another
out in the country near Pouilly, called Val-la-Reine.
Some years later she bought another, called Bagnolet,
with a good deal of land and a windmill, besides all
other accessories; it had also about six thousand
elms and many other trees. And in this year she
bought the hôtel Barbette, in the vieille rue du
Temple. This she enlarged, bought all the ground
about it to turn into gardens, and used it as a place
of diversion.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

  <div class="caption">THE LOUVRE FROM THE HÔTEL DE NESLE.</div></div>

<p>During this year one Salmon, a gentleman of
the household of the Queen of England, who had
gone with her to that country on her marriage, arrived
with letters from King Richard, who wished to
send the King and Queen of France news of the
welfare and happiness of their daughter. Charles and
Isabeau, delighted to hear about her, received the
messenger with great honour. Richard appears to
have felt some uneasiness at the friendship between
Henry, son of the Duke of Lancaster, and the Duc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
d’Orléans. For Henry of Lancaster was already his
secret enemy and dangerous rival, and the Duc
d’Orléans was extremely powerful and ambitious;
the Venetians sent ambassadors to him, and European
princes appealed to him as to an independent sovereign.
Year after year the dissension grew deeper between
him and his uncle of Burgundy, who persisted in
retaining the regency, which Louis declared ought to
be his, during the King’s frequent attacks of insanity.</p>

<p>The year 1399 was an unfortunate one in every
way. Troubles and dangers were beginning to gather
in England, threatening the safety of Richard and
Isabelle, and causing the greatest anxiety to the King
and Queen of France. In March and April there
were great floods. The Seine overflowed the whole
country and destroyed the seeds, so that the crops
were ruined and the country made so unhealthy that
the plague began again. For eight days a dreadful
comet flamed in the sky, which every one said foreboded
evil.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>Henry of Lancaster, Earl of Hereford and Derby,
had become Duke of Lancaster through his father’s
death, and having been exiled for treasonable practices
by King Richard was spending some months at the
French court. Richard seized the duchy of Lancaster
and wrote to the King of France, complaining of the
disloyalty of Henry and begging him not to consent
to his marriage with Marie, daughter of the Duc de
Berry, who, though only twenty-three, was a widow
for the second time, and would have brought him
great riches and powerful alliances.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
The Duc de Berry was quite willing to agree to the
marriage, but Charles spoke to the Duke of Burgundy,
who, when Henry, still called Earl of Derby, took
occasion, the King, princes, and court being assembled,
to speak of the matter, said in the name of the
King: “Cousin, we cannot give our cousin to a
traitor.” Henry replied indignantly that he was no
traitor, and defied any one who should call him so;
whereupon Charles, who really liked him, and besides
was weak and confused with illness, softened the
refusal by assuring him that the words of his uncle of
Burgundy were inspired by England, and that no
one in France doubted his honour. That as to the
marriage, it could be spoken of another time, but
first it was necessary that he should be invested with
his duchy of Lancaster. After which wine and dessert
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">épices</i>) were served and the subject dropped.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
Henry of Lancaster, who was crafty enough, succeeded
in deluding and making friends with the King
and princes, even gaining over the Duke of Burgundy;
and then returned to England.</p>

<p>The plague grew worse and worse; so fatal was
the epidemic that it was forbidden at Paris to publish
the lists of the dead. The court moved for a time
into Normandy, there were litanies, sermons, and
processions, but as the monk of St. Denis says, “many
abbeys were nearly depopulated, though the abbey of
St. Denis only lost one brother, who passed without
doubt to the abode of the blessed.” The plague was
about in the country for two years.</p>

<p>Disquieting reports were brought from England to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the French coast by some merchants of Bruges.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> It
was rumoured that a revolution had taken place, that
King Richard had been deposed, and that both he
and the young queen were in captivity. The King
and Queen of France were in the deepest anxiety
about their daughter and nobody could tell what had
happened (which is a strange reflection, in this, the
five-hundredth year after these events). The court
returned to the capital, and suddenly all Paris was
thrown into excitement by the news that the Dame
de Coucy, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande-maitresse</i> to the Queen of England,
had arrived unexpectedly at her family hôtel. Directly
Charles heard of it he rushed to the hôtel de Coucy to
see her. He found her in great alarm and dismay,
having been banished from England, and all that she
told him of the dethronement, imprisonment, and
danger of his son-in-law and the captivity of his
daughter so distressed and incensed him that although
he had been rather unusually well for some little time,
he fell into a frenzy of madness which for the present
rendered him incapable of doing anything.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1400}</div>

<p>The astonishment and anger of all the French
princes at these events knew no bounds. They cursed
the insolent London burghers who had dared to rebel
against their King, were furious with Henry of
Lancaster, of whose resistance to Richard they had
never contemplated such a result; and tried to stir
up against him the inhabitants of the remaining
English possessions in France, but without success;
for although attached to Richard, who was born at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Bordeaux, the inhabitants of Bordeaux, Bayonne, &amp;c.,
were so much better governed, less taxed, and more
prosperous than their French neighbours that they
declined to exchange the English for the French rule.</p>

<p>The people of Paris, discontented and uneasy at the
King’s illness and the various misfortunes that kept
happening, bethought themselves that they never saw
anything of the Dauphin, who was delicate and did
not appear much in public. They therefore insisted
on his being shown to them, and his uncles, in consequence,
made him ride through Paris to St. Denis,
attended by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> of nobles. There was a state
banquet there, and the people, delighted with the
Dauphin and the splendid pageant, thronged the
whole way, singing hymns and litanies, and praying
for the little lad who rode in state for the first and
last time as the heir of France.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The</span> marriage of King Richard with Isabelle
was unadvised, and so I declared when it was
proposed,” said the Duke of Burgundy. “Since the
English have imprisoned King Richard, they will
assuredly put him to death, for they always hated
him because he preferred peace to war.”<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>His words were not long in being fulfilled. No
one can doubt that it was by the order of Henry that
Richard was secretly murdered, and thus came to an
end the project of uniting the Valois and Plantagenets
and closing by this alliance the Hundred Years’ War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1400}</div>

<p>The fate of Isabelle was of course what now occupied
the royal family of France. Her father sent
ambassadors to see her and demanded that she
should immediately be sent back to France with
all her dowry and possessions. Henry IV., on the
other hand, was most anxious that she should marry
his son, now Prince of Wales, who was, as he truly
remarked, of a much more suitable age for her than
Richard had been. But Isabelle would not hear of
this plan. She had been extremely fond of King
Richard, whose visits to her at Windsor or wherever
she happened to be pursuing her studies under the
care of her ladies had been her greatest pleasure and
holidays, and she doubtless looked forward to the
time when, free from every restraint, she would live
and reign always with the handsome, magnificent
hero of romance who treated her with affectionate
kindness and unlimited indulgence. If, as Sainte-Marthe
and other French historians say, and as seems
certain, Isabelle was the eldest daughter of Charles
VI. and was born in 1388, she could not at this time
have been more than twelve years old, but she
appears to have felt for King Richard the kind of
romantic worship that very young girls occasionally
feel for a man much older than themselves. At any
rate, she took an extraordinarily prominent part in a
conspiracy to restore Richard, tore the badge of Lancaster
from the liveries of her household, issued a
proclamation declaring that she did not recognise
Henry as king, went with the barons of Richard’s
party to Cirencester, and after his death vehemently
refused to marry the Prince of Wales, asking only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
to be sent back to France to her father and mother;
and a constant interchange of letters upon that subject
went on between the royal families of France and
England during the whole of this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1401}</div>

<p>In January the Dauphin Charles, who had been
gradually growing thinner and weaker, faded away
and died. His doctors could not find out what was
the matter nor do him any good. The King, who
was just then in his right mind, went to St. Denis to
pray for him; the Dukes of Burgundy, Bourbon, and
Orléans went to Ste. Catherine and Notre Dame
for the same purpose, and prayers and processions
went on everywhere, but he died on the 11th of
January in the middle of the night.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>The next brother, Louis, became Dauphin, and the
youngest, Jean, then two years old, was created Duc
de Touraine. The duchy of Guyenne was also added
to the territory of the Dauphin.</p>

<p>The Queen’s father, Stephan of Bavaria, came to
France this year and remained some time. He was
again a widower and Isabeau wanted to marry him
to the widow of the last Sire de Coucy who had great
possessions, but the princes objected to placing a
Bavarian in a powerful position close to Paris, so
it had to be given up.</p>

<p>The King’s attacks got no better; he had six
during 1399. Sometimes he was childish, played,
laughed, and ran about all over the hôtel St. Paul
or wherever he happened to be, so that they had to
wall up a great many of the entrances and places he
could fall out of. At other times he was raving and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
furious, so that it was dangerous to approach him,
and sometimes sad and melancholy. The Queen
was not entirely separated from him, because every
now and then he got well and then they were together
and he gave his orders and often tried to put to rights
the mischief and wrong done in his absence, and
recalled friends who had been exiled or imprisoned.
He had insisted on Juvenal des Ursins, provost of
Paris, being left with him and not molested, and it
was of no use for his enemies to try to prevent it. He
would not listen to them, but exclaimed angrily,
“Where is my provost? I will have my provost!”
He was well for part of the summer of 1400, and was
at services of thanksgiving in consequence at St. Denis
and Notre Dame, but was soon after taken
ill again and not well till Christmas. The Princess
Catherine was born October 27th, at St. Paul.</p>

<p>In spite of the King’s frequent attacks of madness,
the Queen contrived to amuse herself very well.
From what one can gather from the records of the
times she seems to have been generally on good
terms with him when he was well, and not to have
allowed the pleasures and diversions of her life to be
interfered with when he was ill. The court was still
disturbed and excited by the rivalry of the Duchesses
of Burgundy and Orléans, but Isabeau, who, if she
had been a different sort of woman, could and ought
to have ruled them both, did nothing of the kind.
She hated the Duchess of Burgundy and was rather
inclined to be jealous of Valentine, but still on the
whole seems to have got on well enough with her
notwithstanding her liaison with the Duc d’Orléans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Louis and Isabeau were nearly always together; they
made excursions and gave balls and dinners and
suppers at St. Paul, the hôtel Barbette, and other
places; they hunted and drove in the royal forests
and their proceedings created continual gossip and
scandal in society and all over Paris. Louis at the
same time was carrying on a more than usually
scandalous intrigue<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> with the beautiful wife of the
Sire de Canny, which is noticeable because the
result of it was the birth of the great Dunois, the
far-famed Bastard of Orléans, renowned in French
song and story.</p>

<p>The Queen and her children lived chiefly at the
hôtel St. Paul, going backwards and forwards
between it and the Palais, spending two or three
weeks at one and then at the other, making excursions
and visits to other of the royal castles in the
neighbourhood. The plague, or, as they called it,
“the mortality,” was still a good deal about, and
there are notices of men sent to find out if it was
safe to go to different places, as for instance, Jehan
Charron was sent by the Queen to Crécy with letters
to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">receveur</i> to ask if “the mortality” was there,
and another man on another occasion to ride all
night somewhere to make the same inquiry; and
as Isabeau again sent two or three times in April to
different places it must have still been going on. She
also went to St. Ouen and borrowed a litter from the
Abbot of Coulons.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> On May 31st she seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
returned from some excursion, for she dined and
supped at the hôtel Barbette and went to St. Paul
to sleep. Isabeau and Louis, with their suites, would
often go out to dine and sup at one of these châteaux,
especially as the days grew long and the weather hot.
Baignolet, or Bagnolet, near Romainville, with its
wood of elms and other trees, was another of the
Queen’s country-places where they sometimes went,
returning to Paris at night. But the distress, confusion,
and poverty in the kingdom were increasing
rapidly, and the people murmured as the sounds of
music and merriment were heard from the windows
of the hôtel Barbette or the cavalcades of Louis and
Isabeau, with their splendid dresses, trappings, and
horses swept through the streets or passed out of
the gates of Paris.</p>

<p>They were both very fond of horses and rode well,
and wherever she was Isabeau had numbers of pet
animals. Plenty of dogs, both large and small,
monkeys which played about in her rooms, an
enormous aviary of all sorts of birds, French and
foreign, which sang and chattered all about her
palaces, for there were parrots amongst them as
well as doves and little birds. When she moved
she took them with her, and was always buying
more or having them given to her.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>All her children were with her at this time except
the Queen of England, who was expected before
long, and the little nun at Poissy&mdash;that is to say,
her two boys, her second daughter, Jeanne, Duchesse
de Bretagne, who still lived with her, and the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Michelle and Catherine. There is an account of the
offerings made by the Queen and the four elder children
at Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas, Easter,
and all the great festivals. The children all gave the
same.</p>

<p>Also of enormous quantities of sweetmeats and
bonbons made “for the Queen and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enfants de France</i>
(at the New Year); that is to say, for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nos seigneurs</i>
the Dukes of Guyenne and Touraine, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nos dames</i>
the Duchesse de Bretagne et Michelle de France.”
Dragées, coriander, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">paste du roy</i>, preparations of
cinnamon, rose sugar, sugared nuts (perhaps pralines),
and various others in great quantities and several
times; sometimes twenty pounds, sometimes forty,
and then, as one can well imagine, medicines for
the Dukes of Guyenne and Touraine.</p>

<p>Also frequently paper and bottles of ink for the
Queen, and money paid to the messengers who carried
her letters on many occasions to the King, the
Duc and Duchesse d’Orléans, to various abbots,
abbesses, and different people.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>She also had some fools and dwarfs. One called
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Grand Jehan le fol</i> died some time before, and
there is a bill for 12 lbs. of wax for his funeral at
St. Germain d’Auxerrois. These fools were both
male and female; she had one fool, her mother, and
grandmother, besides a Saracen woman some one had
given her, of whom she afterwards made a sister
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sœur converse</i>) in a convent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
In August the young Queen of England came
home. Henry IV. had behaved very badly to her
and to her family, for it was not until after long and
tedious negotiations that he would send her at all,
and when he did he kept nearly all her jewels and
the whole of her dowry. He went to take leave of
and console her and sent her to Calais with a brilliant
escort of nobles and ladies. Her father was just then
in his right senses, and delighted at her coming. He
sent his uncle the Duke of Burgundy to fetch her.
The Duke met her halfway between Calais and
Boulogne, where a magnificent tent was pitched
in which she took wine and refreshments with her
English ladies, who sobbed and cried as she embraced
them all, gave them presents, and took leave of them.
She then joined the Duke of Burgundy, who waited
for her with an escort of six hundred cavalry, and
journeyed by Boulogne, Abbeville, then to Picardy,
and by St. Denis to Paris, where she was restored to
her parents, brothers, and sisters at the hôtel St.
Paul. Charles and Isabeau received her with joy
and affection. The Queen took charge of her and
re-arranged her household, which she diminished in
numbers but placed ladies of higher rank about her.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>The Duc d’Orléans had raised a troop of fifteen
hundred men to go to the assistance of the Emperor
Wenceslas, who had been dethroned by his subjects;
but although he was joined in Luxembourg by the
Duc de Gueldre, who was rash, hot-headed, and a
great friend of his, the expedition came to nothing,
and they returned to Paris together, with the Duc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
d’Orléans’s troop and five hundred men of the Duc
de Gueldre. They were soon joined by the Bretons
who were friends of Clisson, by some Scottish and
Welsh companies in the French service, and by a
number of Normans and all the vassals of Orléans,
ready to fight in his quarrel against the party of
Burgundy.</p>

<p>For the rivalry and hatred between the uncle and
nephew and their families had arrived at such a pitch
that they seemed to be on the verge of a civil war.
Besides the question of the regency between Philippe
and Louis, and the mortal hatred between the
Duchesses of Orléans and Burgundy, it was whispered
that a new cause of offence had arisen. Louis
d’Orléans had a private room&mdash;cabinet, study, or
drawing-room&mdash;the walls of which he had hung
with the portraits of women who he declared had
been his mistresses. This room he generally kept
closed, but one day by chance, Jean, Comte de Nevers,
eldest son of the Duke of Burgundy, went into it and
found his wife’s portrait among the others. That
this was nothing but an infamous boast on the part
of Louis, and that no blame whatever was attached
to the Comtesse de Nevers seems certain, that is to
say, if the story be true at all. At any rate it was
reported and believed at court and related by French
historians, and has been given as a reason for the
tragic climax to the feud between Burgundy and
Orléans. For Jean Sans-peur, as the Comte de Nevers
was nick-named, swore vengeance against his cousin
for this insult; and the Dukes of Orléans and Burgundy,
each with his followers and vassals, fortified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
themselves in their dwellings&mdash;Louis in his hôtel
near the porte St. Antoine, and the Burgundians in
their hôtel d’Artois<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>&mdash;while the citizens trembled at
the thought of these fierce and violent men in the
midst of them longing to be at each other’s throats
and making no secret of their delight at the prospect
of sacking Paris. Seven or eight thousand men on
each side were waiting the signal to draw their swords;
the King was just then mad, and the Queen and Duc
de Berry vainly tried to mediate between them. So
matters went on all through December, but at the
beginning of January, 1402, the Duc de Berry, who
was then living at the hôtel de Nesle, managed to
get his brother and nephew to meet there. It was
no easy matter, as although they sat at the council
together they refused to speak to or salute one
another, and each vehemently opposed whatever
the other proposed. However, he persuaded them
at last to embrace, and ride together through the
streets to proclaim their reconciliation to the people,
and dismiss their soldiers, to the great relief of the
court and Parisians, and at the same time the King
returned to his senses, so there was a general thanksgiving
at St. Denis, and for a time every one breathed
more freely.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1402}</div>

<p>In February Isabeau had another boy, and for the
third time the King and Queen chose the name of
Charles for their son, who was made Comte de
Ponthieu and was afterwards Charles VII.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
In May the Queen gave a great fête at the
hôtel Barbette to the Duc de Gueldre, at which
Louis, Valentine, and several other seigneurs were
present.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>One would almost suppose that serious thunderstorms
in those days must have been more frequent
than at present in the north of Europe, for three of
truly southern violence took place in May and June
of this year. The first, accompanied by a furious
wind and a shower of hailstones as big as a goose’s
egg, destroyed the vines and other crops for sixteen
leagues; in the second the lightning struck the hôtel
St. Paul, penetrated into the Queen’s room, where
that night she was not sleeping,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and consumed the
magnificent curtains of her bed. As a thank-offering
for her escape she sent offerings to several churches,
and to the monks of St. Denis a sum to say three
masses a year for the soul of the late Dauphin. The
third storm, on the last day of June, did more harm
than either of the others; it tore up trees, unroofed
houses, and destroyed a great part of the halle du
Lendit, near St. Denis, but left the part untouched
where the judges of the royal contributions resided.
The people, who were vexed and harassed by them,
remarked that the devil had spared his own abode.
The great cross on the priory de l’Estrée was struck
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
The King went on much the same, being tolerably
well for a few weeks, and then ill for several weeks
more. The Duc d’Orléans had persuaded him to
appoint him regent, and to give him absolute power
over all the Langue d’Oïl, or northern part of France.
Some time after he had an attack of madness, and
Orléans, directly he had the government in his hands,
levied enormous taxes, forced loans from everybody,
seized provisions both of lay and ecclesiastics, and
published a decree for another heavy and universal
tax throughout the kingdom, to which he attached
the signatures of his uncles of Burgundy and Berry,
both of whom at once publicly denied them, saying
that the secretary of their nephew was a forger.
There was a general commotion; Louis was declared
unfit to govern, and even the Queen and Duchesse
d’Orléans saw that this sort of thing could not
possibly go on. So directly the King was better a
council was called, in which the Queen, the Duchesse
d’Orléans, all the princes of the blood, the Constable,
Chancellor, the chief minister, and some of the nobles
took part. By them it was settled that in case of the
King’s death the chief authority should be in the
hands of the Queen until the majority of her son.
Meanwhile the Queen was president of the Council.
The direction of affairs was taken away from the Duc
d’Orléans, and the Duke of Burgundy regained his
power next time the King was ill.</p>

<p>It had been promised by the King and Queen that
the late Dauphin should marry the eldest daughter
of the Comte de Nevers, and she was now betrothed
to the Dauphin Louis, commonly called Duc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
d’Aquitaine,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and it was further arranged that the
Princess Michelle should be married to Philippe,
eldest son of the Comte de Nevers, but that she
should be left to be brought up by the Queen her
mother. The marriage of the Dauphin and Marguérite
of Burgundy was celebrated with great pomp
at Paris in the cathedral of Notre Dame in August
1404. There had been some talk of marrying Jean,
the second son of the King, to another daughter of
the Comte de Nevers, but this idea was given up
and he was betrothed to Jacqueline, only child of
Guillaume, Comte de Hainault, and Marguérite de
Bourgogne, a great heiress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1404}</div>

<p>Not long afterwards the Duke of Burgundy was
taken ill on a journey from Arras, where he had left
the Duchess, to Brussels, in order to visit his aunt,
the Duchesse de Brabant. The roads were very bad,
and though pioneers were sent on before his litter to
smooth and mend them, he could not go on much
further, but stopped at an inn called the “Stag,” and
sent for his three sons, Jean, Antoine, and Philippe.
He expressed repentance for his oppressions, exhorted
his sons to fear God, to be good brothers to each
other, loyal subjects to the King, and to live at peace
with the rest of the royal family, after which he
arranged his affairs and died.</p>

<p>So extravagant had he been that, in spite of his
immense possessions, it was doubtful whether he had
left enough money to pay his debts, for which reason
the Duchess of Burgundy formally renounced <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communauté
de biens</i>, laying her girdle, purse and keys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
upon his coffin, according to the custom. She died
very soon after.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>At the same time the Duc de Berry was very ill,
and when he recovered and found the Duke of
Burgundy was dead he was deeply grieved. While
the former was ill and the King mad, the Duc
d’Orléans, at the head of an armed band, broke into
the Palais one night and carried away nearly all the
money to be found there. The Hundred Years’ War
had begun again, and there were constant fights
going on, towns and castles attacked and taken, seaports
and villages surprised and sacked by warships.
The new Duke of Burgundy was much worse than
the old one, and had not, of course, the same
authority in the council or royal family. The Duc
d’Orléans, though he hated his uncle, was obliged to
have a certain respect for him as a sort of representative
of his father,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> and the King, in spite of putting
a stop every now and then to his tyrannical proceedings,
looked up to him with an amount of consideration
which neither he nor his brother entertained
for Jean Sans-peur, who was as ambitious and
extravagant as his father, without his great qualities,
and was harder, more unscrupulous, more cruel, and
more crafty. The chief princes of the blood who
ruled in council were now the Queen, the Duc de
Berry (the last surviving son of King Jean), Louis le
Bon, Duc de Bourbon, Louis II., King of Sicily (son
of the late Duc d’Anjou, and a much better man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
than his father), Charles III., King of Navarre (also
an excellent character), and Jean Sans-peur, Duke of
Burgundy, besides, of course, the Duc d’Orléans.
But unfortunately the two most influential were the
Dukes of Burgundy and Orléans, the latter being
always supported by the Queen and her brother,
Ludwig of Bavaria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1405}</div>

<p>The brigands had reappeared all over the country
and great distress prevailed, large tracts of land
went out of cultivation, travelling was unsafe owing
to the highwaymen who infested the roads, but the
fêtes at court grew more brilliant and licentious and
the royal favourites more insolent. Charles de
Savoisy, who had long been a favourite of the King,
and was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand-maître d’hôtel</i> to the Queen, was one
of the most conspicuous. One of his pages, galloping
down the streets as a procession belonging to the
university was going by, knocked down some of the
students, out of insolent bravado. The others surrounded
and gave him a blow. The page fled to
the hôtel Savoisy and demanded vengeance, whereupon
the retainers of Savoisy attacked the procession
which was already entering the church of Ste.
Catherine, striking with sticks and swords those who
were still outside, and firing off cross-bows into the
church, wounding several people and injuring the
sacred images, ornaments, and vestments of the
priests. When first Savoisy heard of it, he said his
men had done quite right to maintain the honour
of his house; but finding that the University had
laid a complaint before the Queen and the Dukes of
Burgundy and Orléans, he was frightened and offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
to give up the culprits to be hanged. The University,
however, proceeded with the case, the Duc d’Orléans
took it up, and just then the King came to his senses
and was very angry. He ordered Savoisy to be
banished, his hôtel razed to the ground, and a chapel
built there at his expense instead. Savoisy was, after
a time, recalled and enriched again.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Louis d’Orléans, Isabeau, and her
brother were amassing an enormous amount of
treasure, which they kept in safe places distributed
about. A convoy drawn by six horses and loaded
entirely with gold coin was stopped near Metz, being
on the way to Germany, sent by Isabeau. The
people learned from the drivers of it that several
others<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> of these convoys had safely reached their
destination. But they did not pay their tradesmen
nor any of their debts. The servants of the household
of the King, Dauphin, and other royal children,
could not get their wages, so that thus it was nearly
impossible to procure them proper food, clothes, and
attendance. An Augustine monk named Jacques
Legrand, preaching before the Queen on Ascension
Day, harangued against the dissolute habits of the
court, where he declared that Venus reigned and
corruption was general. He said that drunkenness,
debauchery, and licentious dances went on all night,
that the Queen had introduced the excessive luxury
and extravagance in dress which everywhere prevailed,
as she would hear if she went out in disguise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
The Queen was very angry and some of her ladies
told the monk that they could not imagine why he
was not afraid to say such things, to which he replied
that he could still less understand why they dared to
do them. He treated with indifference the threats
aimed at him, and when some of the courtiers told
the King that he had been speaking disrespectfully
of the Queen and her goings on, he said he was very
glad of it, and that the monk should preach to him in
his oratory on Whitsunday. Charles listened with
much attention to his sermon on the excesses of the
court and society, and when it was over praised him
for his fidelity and courage, took him under his protection,
and resolved to reform the state of things he
complained of. But he fell ill again in June and
remained so during half July, so nothing was done.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>There was a spell of very bad weather just then.
The melting of snow in the mountains of Haute
Bourgogne caused a torrent to rush down from the
gorges carrying stones and rocks. It drowned many
people, broke down the walls of the great abbey of
Cluny, and rushed in, driving the monks up to the
higher stories, where they remained till, in sixteen
hours, the flood went down, and they descended to
dig out the dead bodies from the ruins.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>The Queen and Duc d’Orléans had formed the
project of attaching to their party the Duc de Bar,
cousin of the King, by marrying his son to one of
the daughters of France. As the only available one
was the Princess Marie, notwithstanding her vows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
and dedication of the child at Poissy, Isabeau,
accompanied by Louis, set out for that convent to
see her daughter and talk to her on the subject.
She found, however, that instead of a ready consent,
which she doubtless expected, the Princess Marie,
then about twelve years old, absolutely refused to
leave the convent. The Queen talked for a long
time to her daughter, and the Duc d’Orléans added
his persuasions, but it was no use, she would not hear
of it. She said to the Queen that she had placed
her there, she was dedicated to God, and she should
stay there, adding, “You have made a gift to God
and you cannot recall it.”</p>

<p>The King was ill just then, but when he got better
they persuaded him to try his influence. He consented
rather reluctantly, but said she should do as
she chose. He went to see her and asked whether
she would consent to leave the convent and marry
(she had, of course, not yet taken the irrevocable
vows). But the child replied that she had promised
to be the bride of Christ, and would hold to her vow
unless her father could find her a better and more
powerful bridegroom.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> The Queen and Duc d’Orléans,
after their unsuccessful visit to the young princess,
went to hunt in the forest of St. Germain. There
a frightful storm came on. Isabeau, as usual, was
terrified. Louis got off his horse and took refuge in
her carriage. The horses took fright and ran away
down to the river, into which they would certainly
have plunged had not a man caught hold of them
and cut the traces, or whatever were the straps that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
fastened them to the carriage. The lightning struck
the room where the Dauphin was in Paris, and killed
one of his favourite esquires. The Dauphin was
dreadfully frightened but not hurt. His attendants
consoled him and had holy water thrown about the
room.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> The people said that these floods and storms
were caused by the conduct of the Queen and Duc
d’Orléans, who seem to have been of the same
opinion, for they were for a short time seized with
remorse and declared they would pay their debts.
Louis even went so far as to summon his creditors
to his hôtel to receive their money, but when they
came he had changed his mind and would not pay
them&mdash;at least, only those who had come from a great
distance.</p>

<p>One day the King, recovering suddenly from an
attack of insanity, and finding everything in a state
of confusion and discomfort, began to inquire the
meaning of this condition of things. The Queen and
the Duc d’Orléans were away, so he questioned the
governess of the Dauphin, who told him that she
really could not get proper clothes and scarcely
proper food for the Dauphin and his brothers and
sisters, that the Queen would not attend to the
matter, and she did not know what to do. Charles
was exceedingly angry and grieved, for he was very
fond of his children, and he sent for the Dauphin
and asked him if it were true. The boy hesitated,
but after a little persuasion told his father that it was,
only that his mother had by caresses and entreaties
made him promise not to tell his father. Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
then asked him how long it was since he had been
with his mother, to which he replied, about three
months. The King thanked the governess for her
faithfulness, begged her to take care of the children,
gave her a gold cup he had been drinking from to
reward her services, promising to do more for her
afterwards. Then he called a council and sent for
the Duke of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>The Queen and the Duc d’Orléans, when they heard
he was coming, fled to Melun and fortified themselves
there; which was easy enough as it was a very strong
place on an island in the Seine. It had been the
headquarters of the party of Navarre, as it had
belonged to Queen Blanche in the reign of Jean and
Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>In order to prevent the Dauphin from falling into
the hands of the Duke of Burgundy, they sent word
to Ludwig of Bavaria, the Queen’s brother, to bring
not only him but the children of Burgundy also, to
the Queen’s country house at Pouilly, where they
went to wait for them. But the Parisians got to hear
of it, and sent in haste to meet the Duke of Burgundy
and tell him to come as fast as he could, for the
Queen had sent for the Dauphin and they were
afraid she was going to take him to Germany. Jean
Sans-peur, at the head of a strong body of armed
men, pushed on at full speed, but found when he got
there that they had already started. He rode after
them and caught them up at about a league and a
half from Paris. They had been taken by boat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Vitry and had slept at Villejuif. It was pouring
with rain. The Duke of Bavaria represented that
the Queen had sent for the children and begged the
Duke of Burgundy, who had much the stronger party
of the two, not to prevent his obeying her orders.
The Duke of Burgundy rode up to the Dauphin’s
litter, and, opening the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portière</i>, asked him if it were
by his own free will that he had left Paris. The
Dauphin replied that he would much rather go back
there to his father; upon which the Duke of Burgundy
ordered him to return at once, and himself took hold
of the bridles of the horses and turned them back
towards Paris. The Duke of Bavaria accompanied
him, and the Dauphin was soon lodged in the Louvre
while the Duke of Burgundy fortified himself in his
hôtel d’Artois.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1406}</div>

<p>The rest of the party returned to Pouilly, where
they found Isabeau and Louis just going to dinner.
But on hearing what had happened they were so
alarmed that, without even waiting to dine, they fled
to Melun and took refuge there.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>There was now open war between the Queen and
Duc d’Orléans and the Burgundian party, and the
royal family was divided and perplexed. The King
of Sicily and Duc de Bourbon tried to make peace
and came to Melun for that purpose, but it was no
use; the Queen would not see them and the Duc
d’Orléans would not listen to them. He said the
capture of the Dauphin was an insult to the Queen
and to himself. They went back in despair, and
begged the Duc de Berry to try. He also went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Melun, but it was no use; the Queen would not go
back to Paris.</p>

<p>She was at this time very angry with some of the
members of her household who had been spreading
scandal about her. She dismissed several of her
maids-of-honour, among them one who had been her
great favourite, whom she often consulted, and who
kept her seal. She put two of the gentlemen of her
household in prison and kept them there for some
time, in spite of the entreaties of their friends that
they might be brought to trial.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>However, a conference was held at Vincennes,
peace was patched up, and they all returned to
Paris, where the Queen took up her abode again
with the King at St. Paul, the Duc d’Orléans at
his hôtel near the Bastille, the Duke of Burgundy
occupied the hôtel d’Artois, the King of Sicily the
hôtel d’Anjou, and the Duc de Berry the hôtel de
Nesle. Each of these hôtels was a fortress, and all
the streets around them were defended with chains
and wooden doors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the King had another attack worse
than ever. He was very fierce, so that no one dared
go near him, and refused to undress or wash. This
went on so long, and he got into such a dreadful
state, that the doctor said it must be stopped somehow.
Ten or twelve men therefore disguised themselves,
wore armour under their clothes, and
blackened their faces. Then they rushed into the
King’s room, “terrible to see,” as the chronicler
remarks. The King was so frightened that he let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
them get close to him, and then they seized him,
undressed and washed him, and put clean clothes
on him. He soon began to get better, but for some
time did not know any one but Juvenal des Ursins,
who used to go to see him, and whom he would
recognise and talk to. Shortly after he recovered
his senses.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>On the 16th of June, 1406, there was a total eclipse
of the sun between six and seven in the morning.
It lasted half an hour, “and,” says the chronicler,
“nothing whatever could one see, any more than
if it had been night and there had been no
moon.” People crowded into the churches, and
every one thought the world was coming to an
end. “However, the thing passed off, and the
astronomers assembled and said that the thing was
very strange and the sign of a great evil to come.”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>Two more royal marriages took place. Isabelle,
Queen of England, was married to Charles, eldest
son of the Duc d’Orléans, and her little brother Jean,
to Jacqueline, daughter of the Comte de Hainault
and niece of the Duke of Burgundy. Isabelle hated
this marriage and cried all the time, it was said at
court, because she thereby lost the title of Queen of
England. Miss Strickland, in her life of that Queen,
observes that if she had been so anxious to keep the
crown of England, she could easily have done so by
marrying King Henry V., and that her grief was
caused by her love for King Richard. But at any
rate, it is not difficult to understand that a girl of
seventeen might well object to be married to a boy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
fifteen,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> and her cousin, besides the fact of his being a
subject while she had been a queen. Miss Strickland
goes on to state that after a short time she became
reconciled to this marriage, Charles of Orléans being
accomplished and precocious beyond his years, and
devoted to her, but it was cut short by her early
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1407}</div>

<p>After the weddings the Comtesse de Hainault
wished to take the Duc de Touraine back with her.
The Queen objected, and a dispute arose, but as it
had been agreed in the contract that he should be
under her care, she got her way, took leave of the
Queen (the King was then ill), and returned to
Hainault. The Count came to meet them with a
brilliant suite and received the young prince with
great ceremony, and in every place through which
they passed was music and rejoicing. The children
had the household of sovereign princes, and the
Count tried to educate his son-in-law in the ways
of the country, that he might live in harmony with
his future subjects. The King, when he recovered,
made no objection, but consented to the Count’s
request that his son should be brought up in
Hainault.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p>Never within the memory of any one alive had
been seen such a winter as that of 1407. The snow
lay deep on the ground, wells were frozen to an
extraordinary depth, wine was frozen in the barrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
and bread at the bakers. Many people died of the
cold, and it was known as “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le grand hiver</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The
frost lasted sixty-six days, beginning in November.
Louis d’Orléans had been ill on and off all the
autumn, and had been staying at Beauté for the
benefit of the fresh air of the forest which his father
had so loved. Valentine and her children were still
in the country, and the King at the Louvre. Isabeau
had for some time been living in the hôtel Barbette,
where she had given birth to her twelfth and last
child, who was christened Philippe and died soon
after. Isabeau was still weak, and had not recovered
from her illness; she had displayed extraordinary
grief at the death of this baby, for whom it was said
she showed more affection than for any of her other
children. She was altogether low and depressed in
spirits, and Louis came every day to see and console
her.</p>

<p>He was just then living at the hôtel de Nesle,
not the great palace opposite the Louvre, but the
one afterwards called the hôtel de Soissons, whence
he and his daily rides to the hôtel Barbette were
known and watched by the men of Burgundy.</p>

  <div class="caption">HOTEL BARBETTE.</div></div>

<p>On Wednesday evening, November 23, 1407,
Louis and Isabeau were having supper and spending
the evening together at the hôtel Barbette. Isabeau
was splendidly dressed in long robes and an enormous
headdress with horns, covered with jewels. It was
only eight o’clock, but the night was dark and all the
shops in that quarter were closed. Suddenly a
messenger from the King was announced for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Duc d’Orléans, who said that he desired at once to
see the Duke, as he had an important matter to
speak to him about.</p>

<p>Louis rose, took his leave, and went out. Mounting
his mule,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> he rode carelessly along, swinging his
embroidered glove and humming a song as he
went. He was only accompanied by two esquires,
both riding the same horse, a young German page
or esquire, and four or five <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">varlets</i> carrying torches.
As they passed a dark corner by a wall close to
the house of the Maréchal d’Evreux the horse of
the two esquires seems to have been aware of the
presence of some men concealed in the darkness,
snorted violently, and ran away. The assassins
rushed out and assailed the Duke, who, thinking it
was a mistake, exclaimed, “I am the Duc d’Orléans,”
to which, however, the reply was, “It is you we want.”
The two esquires looked round, expecting he was
following them, and seeing the struggle, managed to
stop their horse, and returned. Louis d’Orléans lay
dead on the ground, covered with wounds; his
German page, who had defended him to the last,
died as they came up, muttering, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon maître</i>.”
The assassins rode off at full speed, laughing and
strewing <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chaussetrapes</i>, or calthrops, behind them,
and setting fire to a house to divert attention from
their flight. In a moment cries of alarm resounded
on all sides; the street was full of torches; some of
the followers of the Duke rushed back to the hôtel
Barbette to tell the Queen, who heard the tumult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
with terror and did not know what was happening.</p>

<p>Félibien says that the murderers came out of a
house called Notre Dame, because over the door was
an image of our Lady, and that it was opposite that
of the Maréchal de Rieux. This house they had
hired for the purpose, and had been hidden in it for a
fortnight. They were eighteen in number. The wife
of a shoemaker said that she opened her window, and
looking out into the street, she saw the Duke and his
little group of attendants come out of the hôtel
Barbette; then the attack of the murderers, the short
fight, the fall of the Duke, his page, and another of
his followers; and that after all was over a tall man
wrapped in a cloak, with a red hood drawn over his
face, came out of a house opposite, which had lately
been bought by the Duke of Burgundy, and pushing
with his foot the body of Orléans, said, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il est mort,
éteignez tous et allons nous en.</i>” She shouted, “<em>Murder!
Fire!</em>” out of the window, but they turned with
threatening words and ordered her to be silent. The
Maréchal de Rieux, a friend and partisan of Louis
d’Orléans, hearing the clamour and cries, came out of
his hôtel with a torch, and to his horror found him
lying dead, with his German page also dead and
another of his followers dying; the rest had fled.
The body of Louis was carried to the nearest church,
and then to that of the Céléstins, and laid in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chapelle d’Orléans</i>, which he had founded.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>Isabeau, wild with fear, ordered her litter at once,
got into it, and was carried to the hôtel St. Paul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
where she took refuge with the King, taking up her
abode in the room adjoining his; while the news
spread through Paris, and the nobles, hastily arming,
flocked to St. Paul to guard the King, all the gates
of Paris were closed but two, which were strictly
guarded and count kept of all who passed out or in.</p>

<p>The King, filled with grief and anger, sent for the
provost of Paris and ordered him to find out the
assassins, and there was a general wonder who was
the instigator of this crime. Suspicions fell upon the
Sieur de Canny, who had cause enough to hate Louis
d’Orléans, but it appeared that he had not been in or
near Paris at the time; and on the 25th the provost
of Paris presented himself at the hôtel St. Paul where
the princes were assembled, as a council was about
to be held, and came into the apartment where they
were all waiting for the time for it to begin. The
King of Sicily and the Dukes of Burgundy, Berry,
and Bourbon were present, besides other princes of
the blood.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy was standing by a window
talking to the King of Sicily when the provost of
Paris appeared and said that he believed he could
find out the author of the crime if he might have
permission to search the hôtels of all the princes.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> It
appeared that a scullion who had acted as spy for the
murderers had been seen to escape and enter the
hôtel d’Artois, or Burgundy.</p>

<p>All the princes at once gave leave for their palaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
to be searched except the Duke of Burgundy, who
hesitated and changed colour, and the King of Sicily
asked him if he knew anything of the affair. Taking
him and the Duc de Berry aside, he confessed his
guilt. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est moi qui ai fait le coup et ne sais comme
il s’est fait, il faut que le diable m’ait tenté et surpris.</i>”
The princes looked at each other in consternation.
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dieu!</i>” exclaimed the Duc de Berry, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">je perds
aujourd’hui mes deux neveux!</i>”</p>

<p>Next day, when he presented himself to attend the
council at the hôtel de Nesle, the Duc de Berry
stopped him, saying he had better not go in, as it
would please no one to see him there; he had better
go back to his hôtel. The Duke of Burgundy left the
palace, the Comte de Saint-Pol refusing to accompany
him, got fresh horses, and fled to the nearest fortress
belonging to him, cutting the Pont Saint Maxence
behind him to stop pursuit. The Duc de Bourbon
indignantly asked the Duc de Berry, “Why did you
let him go?” He grieved sincerely for his nephew,
and never again would sit at a council, or enter a
room, or go to any place where the Duke of Burgundy
was.</p>

confused and weak as to be unable to take any

<p>It will be remembered that, as was explained in
the former volume,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> Edward III. of England claimed
that throne through his mother, Isabella, daughter of
Philippe IV., and persisted in it, although it was
finally decided that the Valois, as nearest heirs male,
descending from Charles, brother of that King, were
the lawful possessors of the throne ascending to the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">loi salique</i> or Salic law, which henceforward was
adopted by the country; and notwithstanding the
existence of daughters and grandsons through
them, who would have come before the sister of
the then last Kings, Louis Hutin, Philippe-le-Long
and Charles-le-Bel, supposing the female line to have
been admitted at all.</p>

<p>But Henry IV. had still less pretensions than
Edward III., for he was not the lawful heir even of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the English King. If, as has been shown, the claim
of King Edward was an unjust one, of course he had
no ground to stand upon. If, on the other hand, it
were a just one, then it would belong, not to the
descendant of his third son, John of Gaunt, Duke of
Lancaster, but to the Mortimers, who descended by
the female line from Lionel, Duke of Clarence, his
second son, Richard II., son of the Black Prince,
having left no children. In fact, the Mortimers were
the right heirs to the crown of England.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>However, the English were still a very serious
danger for France, and the Duke of Burgundy would
have been an invaluable ally, whom, in consequence,
they did not dare to drive to desperation. And as
he always posed as a friend of the people when he
wanted to injure Louis d’Orléans, who was supposed
to be their chief oppressor, he was very popular with
the credulous mob, who did not, after the first horror
caused by the assassination of the King’s brother,
trouble themselves much about it, but said, alluding
to the knotted stick which had been the emblem of
Orléans, and the plane of Burgundy, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le bâton
noueux est enfin raboté.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>Louis d’Orléans had been buried with great solemnity
in the Chapelle d’Orléans of the Céléstins, all the
princes of the blood, including his murderer, attending
in white mantles, the day before the council at which
the Duke of Burgundy had owned his guilt. Valentine
was still in the country when the news was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
brought to her, with her children. Overwhelmed
with grief, she sent her daughter and her two eldest
boys, the young Duc d’Orléans and the Comte de
Vertus, for safety, to the strong castle of Blois, and
with her youngest son and her daughter-in-law, the
Princess Isabelle, she set off, in spite of the fearful
cold, to Paris, where they arrived on December 10th,
went to the hôtel St. Paul, threw themselves at the
feet of the King, who had got better again, and implored
justice on the murderer. Charles received his
daughter and sister-in-law with kindness and affection,
and promised all they asked, but early in January
another of his attacks came on, and Valentine seeing
that nothing could be done and not thinking herself
safe, as the Duke of Burgundy seemed all powerful
at Paris where he had returned amid the acclamations
of the mob, retired to Blois, and fortified herself
there with her children.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1408}</div>

<p>The great frost broke up and the melting of the
snow and ice swelled the rivers into frightful torrents,
carrying away houses, trees, and cattle. The monk
of St. Denis says that he saw in the Seine masses of
ice three hundred feet long dashing against each
other, destroying boats and bridges. At Paris, on the
second day of the thaw, the pont St. Michel was
swept away, with all the houses on it, and so was a
wooden bridge on the other branch of the Seine.
Much it was feared that the Grand Pont also would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
give way, as it shook terribly with the icicles, but
only fourteen shops fell. The roads were impassable
by reason of the rocks and trees with which they
were covered by the floods. Many mills were destroyed,
and the price of bread rose. The King
ordered all bakers to sell flour at the same price, but
great distress prevailed, and no one alive had ever
seen such a winter.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>About May the Princess Marie took the perpetual
vows at Poissy, in presence of the King, Queen, and
court.</p>

<p>The King went to Melun to visit the Queen, who
had sent for the provost of Paris and made him tell
her all that had been done there, and found that the
Duke of Burgundy had been trying to throw upon
her the same suspicions of magic that he had formerly
done upon the Duchesse d’Orléans. He had now
left Paris, and Isabeau, greatly incensed, resolved to
return there in state. Charles was taken ill again
the day after his visit to Melun, and Isabeau sent for
several of the princes, including Berry, Bourbon,
Alençon, and the young Duc de Bretagne, husband
of her second daughter Jeanne, and went to Paris
escorted by them, in a gilded coach, the Dauphin
Louis, who was usually called Duc d’Aquitaine,
riding in the procession for the first time, with a
guard of three thousand men in armour. Proclamations
were issued that any one misbehaving or causing
any disturbance would be imprisoned in the Châtelet,
which was indeed no desirable place of abode.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
The Queen took up her residence in the strong
fortress of the Louvre with her children, where she
doubtless felt safer than in the hôtel St. Paul, and had
herself appointed regent in case of the King’s illness.</p>

<p>The princes were divided between their anger at
the murder of Orléans and their fear of Burgundy,
but as he was now absent, the Duchesse d’Orléans
and her children came to Paris and appealed to the
Duc d’Aquitaine and other princes for vengeance on
the murderer of their husband and father. The King
was just then ill again. As he, when in his mad state,
either did not know Isabeau at all, or else was so
fierce that she could not go near him without danger
to her life, she had ceased to take much trouble about
him. In fact, a young girl called Odette had been
chosen, with the full consent of the Queen, to be his
mistress and constant companion. She seems to
have been the only consolation of Charles, who was
devoted to her; always listened to her in his most
insane moments, and did whatever she told him.
She was called by the household and courtiers, “La
petite reine.” Their daughter, named Marguérite de
Valois, was recognised by the King, and afterwards
married to a French noble.</p>

<p>The monk of St. Denis says she was of low origin,
and such has been the general opinion; but M. Vallet
de Viriville says there is good reason to suppose her
to have been the daughter of Odin de Champdivers,
a Burgundian gentleman who had a château near
Dôle, where, after the death of Charles, she took
refuge.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
While the Queen and princes were deliberating on
the means of punishing Jean Sans-peur, the news of
his victorious return from an expedition to Flanders
filled them with consternation. The Queen first tried
to borrow money to escape with the King and her
children, but no one would lend her any. The King,
therefore, left Paris with the Duc de Bourbon on the
3rd of November, and went by boat to the Céléstins,
and thence to St. Victor with 1,500 men. The Queen,
with the Duke and Duchess of Aquitaine,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> the rest of
the children, the Duc de Berry, the Kings of Sicily
and Navarre left two days later, went down the Loire
to Tours and joined the King. The Duke of Burgundy
entered Paris amidst cries of “Noël! Noël!”
from the populace.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>Valentine Visconti, Duchesse d’Orléans, despairing
of getting either justice or vengeance, returned to
Blois with her children, and also the little son of
Louis d’Orléans and the Dame de Canny, the afterwards
famous Dunois, the Bastard of Orléans.</p>

<p>Jean Sans-peur, finding the King, Queen, and
royal family all gone, was much disturbed. He
resolved to negotiate, and persuaded his brother-in-law,
the Comte de Hainault, who was also father-in-law
to the King’s second son, to go to Tours for that
purpose.</p>

<p>Perhaps what made peace with Burgundy more
possible was the death of Valentine Visconti on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
4th of December, at Blois. Overcome with grief,
disappointment, and anxiety, her health had given
way. She took for her device a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chante-pleurs</i><a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
dropping tears, and the motto “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Rien ne m’est plus;
plus ne m’est rien</i>,” which she had embroidered on the
black hangings of her room. She always charged
her sons to avenge their father, and pointing to the
little Jean (afterwards Dunois), then six years old,
she said, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Celui-là m’a été enlevé, il n’y a point
d’enfant si bien taillé pour venger la mort de son père.</i>”</p>

<p>As the result of the negotiations an interview was
arranged in solemn state in the church of Notre
Dame de Chartres. A platform was raised before
the great crucifix, all around sat the King, Queen,
Kings of Sicily and Navarre, Dukes de Berry and
Bourbon, the Cardinal de Bar, the Archbishop of
Sens, and all the princes and great nobles. The
Duke of Burgundy, with his advocate, then came
forward and knelt before the King, the advocate
making a speech of which the arrogance was only
thinly veiled by the formal respect for the sovereign,
ending by asking pardon for the Duke of Burgundy,
to which the latter added, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sire, de ce ie vous prie.</i>”
The King was silent, but the Duc de Berry knelt
before the Queen, whispering something to her, upon
which she rose, and with the Duc d’Aquitaine and the
Kings of Sicily and Navarre, knelt and joined in the
request, to which he replied, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Nous le voulons et
accordons pour l’amour de vous.</i>” The Duke of
Burgundy and his advocate then approached the
young princes of Orléans, who in deep mourning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
and with tearful eyes stood behind the King; the
advocate saying: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Messeigneurs voici le Duc de Bourgogne
qui vous prie qu’il vous plaise oster de vos cœurs
la vengeance ou hayne que porriez avoir contre luy
pour l’éxcés fait et perpetré en la personne de Monseigneur
d’Orléans vostre père et que doresnavant vous
demourez et soyez bons amys ensemble</i>;” to which
Burgundy added, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">et de ce ie vous en prie</i>.” The
princes of Orléans, of whom the eldest, the young
Duke, was then seventeen, stood in silence, and it was
only in obedience to the desire of the King that they
reluctantly, and with tears, answered, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sire, puisqu’il
vous plait commander, nous luy accordons sa
requeste, et luy pardonnons toute la maleveillance que
aurions contre luy car en rien ne voulons désobéir à
chose qui soit à vostre plaisir.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Peace was then signed,
sealed, and sworn upon the gospels, but in spite of
the grandeur and solemnity of the scene and the
intense interest and importance of the occasion, the
whole thing was a hollow and worthless form. There
was no repentance in the heart of Jean Sans-peur,
and no forgiveness in those of the sons, friends, and
followers of Louis and Valentine d’Orléans. As to
the Queen, she was too weak and shallow for any
lasting passion or feeling, in which her son the Duc
d’Aquitaine closely resembled her. He expressed
great anger at the murder of his uncle, and yet he
persuaded his father to appoint the Duke of Burgundy
his guardian. It is true that at this time he was only
twelve years old, but the same vacillating, unreliable
character was the despair of his friends and of France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
during his life. Burgundian one week and Armagnac
the next, he, like his mother, was neither to be trusted
by friends nor feared by enemies.</p>

<p>The King and Queen returned to Paris in March.
All the Queen’s ladies were dressed in white, and
there was much feasting at the palaces of the King
and Queen, and the hôtels of the nobles and chief
burghers.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>In June the Princess Michelle was married to the
eldest son of the Duke of Burgundy, Philippe, Comte
de Charolais, and this marriage turned out very
happily, for Michelle, then seventeen years old, was
a charming character, like her sisters, and Philippe
was in most respects unlike his fierce, unscrupulous
father. Gay, kind-hearted, and affectionate, he was
known as Philippe-le-Bon, and was adored by his
subjects as no other duke had been since all Burgundy
mourned for Philippe de Rouvre, the last of
the beloved Capétienne house.</p>

<p>In August the Duke of Burgundy was hastily
summoned by the King and Queen to come to Paris
and bring a strong body of men-at-arms who might
be wanted, as there was a serious quarrel going on
with the Duc de Bretagne, husband of their second
daughter Jeanne; who had not only brought over<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> a
number of English and made war on the Comtesse
de Penthièvre, but had quarrelled with his wife because
she opposed his proceedings, and was even said to
have struck her. Her father and mother were, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
course, much incensed at this, so they resolved to send
the Duke of Burgundy and some of the other princes
to attack and subdue him. Jean Sans-peur was all
the more willing as the Comte de Penthièvre had
married one of his daughters, so he came at once with
his troops, and preparations were going on vigorously
for the invasion of Bretagne; but the Duke, hearing
of the indignation of his mother-in-law, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">et de ceux
qui gouvernoit le roi</i>,” became so frightened that he
came to Paris and made his submission. All the
princes were very angry, and the Duc d’Orléans, his
brother-in-law, told him that the lion in his heart was
not bigger than that of a child of a year old.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> In fact,
he seems to have been what some in these days would
call “well hustled,” and it would appear that the
quarrel between him and the Princess Jeanne was
made up. One may imagine that at any rate he must
have altered his conduct as we find years after, that
the Penthièvres having taken him prisoner and
threatened his life, she persuaded her brother, the
Dauphin, to forbid them to do him any injury, and
taking up arms herself she besieged and took their
castles and forced them to set him at liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1409}</div>

<p>The next calamity that happened was the death, at
Blois, of the Princess Isabelle, Duchesse d’Orléans, in
giving birth to her first child. The young duke was
overwhelmed with grief, and the only consolation he
seemed to find at first was in the infant daughter who
survived.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> In her “Life of Isabelle de Valois,” Miss
Strickland declares that the second marriage of
Isabelle had been an extremely happy one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
remarks upon the talents and virtues of the young
Charles d’Orléans, the well-known poet, of whose despairing
verses on the death of Isabelle she gives a
translation, also of a later poem, which she declares to
have been written on the same subject.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> The young
duke gave the rich dresses belonging to her to make
vestments for the abbey of St. Denis, where prayers
were said for her.</p>

<p>But none of the misfortunes that befel the royal
family or the country stopped the gaieties of the court.
The King was at the Palais for Christmas and sent
for the Queen, who was at Vincennes, to come and
join him and bring the Duc d’Aquitaine, who had
hitherto remained under her care. The princes went
to meet her and various splendid entertainments took
place when she arrived. She formally gave the Duc
d’Aquitaine into the care of the King, who appointed
the Duke of Burgundy his governor. Nothing, however,
could be done in council without consent of the
Queen. The Ducs de Berry and Bourbon, disapproving
of the overweening power of Jean Sans-peur,
left Paris and retired to their châteaux.</p>

<p>Jeanne, Duchesse de Bretagne, who had a son in
this year, was very anxious that her brother the Duc
d’Aquitaine should come and attend her “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lever</i>.” He
was not allowed to do so, but a seigneur was sent
instead, with splendid jewels as presents for her.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
The monk of St. Denis in his chronicle tells us
that in the early part of July there was a strange
omen in Hainault. Innumerable flocks of birds of
prey assembled and fought in the air, as if leagued
against each other. Storks, herons, and magpies
attacked rooks, crows, and jays, and a fierce battle
ended in the victory of the former, the ground being
strewn with the bodies of the latter, and causing
people “of learning and experience” to say that
bloody battles would soon be going on.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1410}</div>

<p>It was a tolerably safe prediction to make at that
time, more especially as the death of Louis had not,
as the Duke of Burgundy supposed it would, annihilated
the party of his opponents. On the contrary
the Orléanists married the young Duke Charles, now
a widower, to Bonne, daughter of Bernard, Comte
d’Armagnac, one of the most powerful nobles in the
kingdom. He claimed descent from Clovis and had
married a daughter of the Duc de Berry. Brave,
liberal, unscrupulous, a faithful friend, and a relentless
foe, he was the man chosen by the princes to take the
leadership of the party which none of them were
capable of holding themselves. From this time the
name of the party changed from Orléanist to
Armagnac, and the strife became fiercer and more
desperate than it had ever been under the leadership
of the more gentle, easy going Louis.</p>

<p>The royal family and court had sustained a great
loss in the death of the Duc de Bourbon, who died in
August, 1410, on his way to help the Armagnacs at
the head of his troops, for he had never for an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
been persuaded to condone the murder of his nephew
by the Duke of Burgundy. The lofty character and
noble life of Louis II., Duc de Bourbon, stand out
conspicuously amidst the corruption and depravity
with which he was surrounded during his later years.
When the court and rule of his brother-in-law and
sister had fallen to his nephews, Isabeau, and the
brothers of Charles V., the Duchesse de Bourbon
withdrew from court and lived almost entirely with
her children on their own estates in the Bourbonnais,
where he also spent a great deal of his time, although
obliged to be frequently at Paris and elsewhere with
his nephews, to whom he was always a good friend
and who were extremely fond of him. The only
letter existing in the handwriting of Charles VI. is to
him. As a son, brother, husband, father, soldier,
statesman, and ruler, he was idolised, and after his
death his funeral train, as it travelled through the
country was followed by crowds of people weeping
and lamenting. He had, with the consent of the
Duchess, intended after this last expedition to retire
to the monastery of the Céléstins at Vichy, and after
his death two knotted cords were found under his
clothes, which he wore secretly. He knew he could
not recover, received the last sacraments and prayed
constantly, dying peacefully at the age of seventy-three,
leaving a stainless name and a heroic example.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the dissensions amongst the different
members of the royal family only increased. The
marriage of the Duc d’Aquitaine with Marguérite de
Bourgogne had turned out as badly as possible. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
slighted and neglected her and made open love to
other people. One of the ladies of the Queen’s
household especially was his mistress, he wore her
colours and device to the great indignation of the
Duke of Burgundy, who took the part of his daughter.
Isabeau seems to have done the same, for it is frequently
mentioned that the Duchesse d’Aquitaine was
with the Queen while the Duke was elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1412}</div>

<p>There was open war between Burgundians and
Armagnacs. The Duke of Burgundy had placed his
own people in the household of his son-in-law, and
tried by all means to gain influence over him, which
seemed to be easy enough, and to retain it, which
was not easy at all, as no dependence whatever could
be placed on any friendship, affection, or opinion of
his lasting a single week. The Comte de Clermont,
Duc de Bourbon by the death of his father, was like
him, an Orléanist. In company with the Ducs de
Berry and Orléans, the Comtes d’Alençon and
Armagnac, and the Sire d’Albret he had entered into
a treaty with the English, offering, among other concessions,
to restore to them the duchy of Aquitaine.
This treaty was discovered and the above-named
princes, who had taken refuge in Bourges, were besieged
there by the Burgundians about the end of June, 1412.</p>

<div id="illo_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;">
  <img src="images/i_273.jpg" width="358" height="449" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">BOURGES.</div></div>

<p>But the Duc d’Aquitaine began to get tired of these
constant quarrels of Burgundians and Armagnacs, for
whose sake the kingdom, which was his own inheritance,
was being wasted and destroyed, and he resolved
to put a stop to the war. To the consternation of his
father-in-law he forbade the gunners and engineers to
fire any more, or to demolish or destroy the walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
gates, or fortifications of Bourges, saying that the war
had gone on long enough. The Duke of Burgundy
said that the sooner it was finished the better, only it
must be by the complete subjection of the Armagnacs.
To which the Duc d’Aquitaine rejoined that he would
doubtless welcome their submission to the King, his
father, but that in any case this had gone on too long
already, to the detriment of the kingdom; that the
discredit would fall upon him, the heir of France, and
that the opposing party were his uncles, cousins, and
near relations, against whom he refused any longer to
fight. The Duke of Burgundy was obliged to submit,
the siege was raised and peace for a short time
restored.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>The princes and court returned to Paris, where the
usual amusements and festivities began again. The
Duc d’Aquitaine was the leader of all the follies and
dissipation that went on. He was as extravagant and
licentious as his uncle Louis d’Orléans had been, without
his intellect or charm.</p>

<p>Louis d’Orléans, in spite of his countless infidelities,
lived on good terms with his wife, but the Duc
d’Aquitaine seems not only to have been unfaithful,
but brutal. He was not without cultivation, spoke
Latin almost as well as French, and was exceedingly
fond of music, but he cared nothing for the affairs of
state, spent his nights in balls, suppers, and entertainments,
and stayed in bed all day. His life
seemed even more full of dissipation and debauchery
than those of his father and uncle, while it was not
redeemed by any of the gallant, warlike deeds of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
soldier’s life, such as had won them popularity even in
early boyhood. Every one complained of the Duc
d’Aquitaine; his father-in-law was indignant at his
behaviour to his wife, very serious apprehensions were
entertained for his health amongst the members of the
royal family, the people pointed to the example of his
father, whose manner of life had caused his madness,
and predicted that if he went on so he would lose his
reason in the same way, and even the Queen several
times threatened that unless he reformed his conduct
in some degree the succession to the throne should be
transferred to his brother Jean, Duc de Touraine, who,
in the charge of his father-in-law, the Comte de
Hainault, was being better brought up.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was May, 1413, the court was at Saint Paul.
The King had just recovered from one of his
attacks. Every one had been, dressed in white hoods,
to Notre Dame to give thanks, and now the important
event was the wedding to be celebrated on the following
day between the Queen’s brother, Duke Ludwig
of Bavaria, and Catherine d’Alençon, widow of Pierre
de Navarre, Comte de Mortaigne.</p>

<p>There had been a good deal of uneasiness in the
air for some time and the war with England was going
on. When peace was made between Burgundians and
Armagnacs, the latter were obliged to break their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
alliance with the English king, whose troops under
his second son, the Duke of Clarence, had ever since
been ravaging Normandy, Picardy, and Maine, notwithstanding
that the little Comte d’Angoulême, the
youngest of the Orléans princes, had been given them
as a hostage. They were also attacking some of the
southern parts of France, and swore they would regain
the duchy of Aquitaine, their ancient patrimony. Two
months ago Henry IV. had died, and the Prince of
Wales, now Henry V., hitherto remarkable chiefly for
his fast, disorderly, somewhat scandalous life, seemed
likely to be a powerful and dangerous enemy. The
populace of Paris were deeply discontented, as well
they might be, for it was openly declared that the
expenses of the King’s household, which used to be
94,000 francs were now 450,000, and yet the tradesmen
were not paid; that although the allowance for
the King and Queen’s alms went on, scarcely any
alms were ever given; that some of the royal servants
and officers received enormous salaries, while others
could never get any wages paid at all; and that, in
spite of the sums allowed for the repair of the King’s
castles and palaces, they were in such a state that they
would soon fall into ruins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1413}</div>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy had his own reasons for
wishing to stir up the people. He was afraid of
certain transactions by which he had got hold of a
large sum of money being made known by Pierre des
Essarts, provost of Paris, who held his receipts for
them, and now belonged to the Orléanists; he was
uneasy about the power and favour of that party
and the estrangement of the Duc d’Aquitaine, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
disliked him because he was so overbearing and
disagreeable.</p>

<p>The Duc d’Aquitaine had been warned that an
attack upon the hôtel St. Paul was intended, and
advised to arm his household, raise the banner with
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i> over the entrance and defend himself.
But while he was deliberating with the other princes,
instead of taking immediate action, as any of his
forefathers would have done, a dreadful noise began
to be heard, and a shouting, howling, desperate mob
was seen to be rushing down the streets towards
the hôtel St. Paul. They surrounded that palace,
planted the standard of the city, and with loud
cries and threats demanded to speak to the Duc
d’Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Among the chief characteristics that distinguish the
history of France from that of any other Christian or
civilised nation are the furious, credulous, ferocious
mobs, whose atrocious deeds continually appear in her
annals, and who seem to belong to no particular century;
for whether we see them murdering nobles and
gentlemen with their wives and children in the fourteenth
century, Huguenots in the sixteenth, waggon
loads of women, young girls, and little children in
the eighteenth&mdash;or priests and unarmed hostages in
the nineteenth, whether they are called Jacques, or
Leaguers, or Septembriseurs, or Communists&mdash;they
evidently do not excite either abhorrence or shame in
the minds of the great mass of their countrymen who
have just raised a statue in Paris in honour of one of
the most bloodthirsty of the wretches who acted as
their leader in the perpetration of those cowardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
and brutal crimes against which the rest of civilised
humanity revolts.</p>

<p>One of these mobs, not a whit more cruel and
savage than those which yelled and howled and
danced through the streets of Paris in our own and
our fathers’ and grandfathers’ days, was now pressing
round the hôtel of the Duc d’Aquitaine at Saint Paul.
They had certainly much reason for their anger and
complaints, but whether their cause is a bad or a good
one the means by which they carry it out are always
atrocious. On this occasion they put forward a
Carmelite monk called Eustace, who gave a harangue
on the calamities, bad government, and generally
disastrous state of things. The Duke of Burgundy
came down, said the King was only just recovered
and could not bear this agitation, and advised them to
go away. But they clamoured for the Duc d’Aquitaine,
who, terrified by the tumult and urged by the Duke
of Burgundy, appeared at a window and promised all
they asked.</p>

<p>One of their leaders, named Jean de Troyes, then
imposed silence, and in a speech received with
enthusiastic applause by the people and with scarcely
concealed indignation by the nobles, declared that
they would do no harm to the Duc d’Aquitaine, but
demanded that his evil counsellors should be given up
to them; and on his chancellor imprudently asking to
whom they referred handed up a list of fifty names,
including not only the principal gentlemen of his
household, but Ludwig of Bavaria, the Queen’s
brother, Edouard, Duc de Bar, cousin of the King,
and several of the Queen’s ladies. The princes could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
not pacify them, the Queen wept and raved, the King
remonstrated in vain; the Duc d’Aquitaine, turning
with a furious look to the Duke of Burgundy, exclaimed,
“Father-in-law, this outrage is your doing,
for the leaders of it are the people of your house.
Know surely that the day will come when you shall
repent of it, for things will not always go on according
to your pleasure.”</p>

<p>Some of the nobles and ladies came down and gave
themselves up, the others were seized by the mob,
who broke into the palace and hunted all over the
rooms and galleries to find them, tearing one gentleman
out of the arms of the Duchesse d’Aquitaine,
who tried to protect him. They were carried away
on horseback and shut up, some in the Palais, some in
the Louvre.</p>

<p>When they were gone, the King went to dinner
and the Duc d’Aquitaine retired with the Queen into
her room, where they shut themselves up and cried.</p>

<p>Something, however, had to be done, so they sent
the Comte de Vertus, who escaped to his brother, the
Duc d’Orléans, told him what had happened, and
how some of the princes were in prison, and the
King, Queen, and Duc d’Aquitaine like prisoners in
the hands of the Parisians, and desired the rest of the
princes to make haste to come and deliver them.</p>

<p>The King of Sicily, the Ducs d’Orléans, Bourbon,
and Bretagne, the Comtes de Vertus and Alençon
accordingly assembled at Vernon, and sent a message
to the populace that unless the prisoners were immediately
set free they would put all Paris to fire and
sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
The Duke of Burgundy saw he had gone too far,
having infuriated the Duc d’Aquitaine and set all the
princes against him, the University of Paris hastened
to disassociate herself with the riots, and the chief
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i>, frightened at what had been done tried
by all means and with many apologies, to divert and
appease the anger of the royal family. The city was
still very unquiet, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">frère Eustache</i> went on preaching
against Aquitaine, saying that the licentiousness and
debauchery of such a life as he was leading had
already caused the madness of his father and the
death of his uncle, and that it would be better to
declare his brother, Jean de Touraine, the heir of
France; while one Léon de Jacqueville forced his way
into the ballroom of his hôtel one night in the middle
of a ball and loudly declaimed against him, saying
that he dishonoured his rank. The Duke struck him
three times with his dagger, but his cuirass saved
him. The ballroom was a scene of confusion, the
mob rushed to attack the hôtel and were only stopped
by the opportune arrival of the Duke of Burgundy,
who dispersed them. The Duc d’Aquitaine was so
agitated by the scene that he spit blood for days
afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>Burgundy, however, saw that he was rapidly losing
friends, and thought it well to send his son, the
Comte de Charolais, away. That young prince,
therefore, with his wife, the Princess Michelle, set off
for Gand, accompanied as far as Lendit by a great
body of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i> of Paris of whom she took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
leave affectionately, begging them to deliver her uncle,
the Duke of Bavaria, and then she proceeded to St.
Denis with her husband, after which they went with
a brilliant train to Gand.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>While all these commotions were going on the
English made a descent upon the county of Eu,
sacked and burnt Tréport and several other towns,
took to their ships and sailed for England with their
plunder. The Armagnacs were devastating the
country, and the Parisians more and more terrified at
the threats of the princes. Their party grew stronger
and stronger, the King ordered the Duc d’Aquitaine
to go and liberate the prisoners, which he did, riding
to the Palais and the Louvre and bringing them all
away with him except the ladies, who had been
liberated soon after they were taken, and two or
three gentlemen who had been killed in the riots.
Bells rang, feasting went on, the rioters were either
seized and punished or else fled, and the princes
entered Paris in triumph.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p>The Duc d’Aquitaine ordered all the favourites of
Burgundy to be seized, one only was spared at the
entreaty of the Duchesse d’Aquitaine, the rest were
arrested or fled. Jean Sans-peur himself, warned
that the streets round the hôtel d’Artois were being
watched by night by the Orléanists who were
crowding into Paris to join the Duc d’Aquitaine,
fled from a hunting party with one gentleman only,
rode at full speed in doubt and fear through the forest
of Bondy, and next day meeting one of his followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
with a band of men-at-arms pursued his journey
safely to Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1414}</div>

<p>For a little while the Armagnacs were triumphant.
The marriage of the Duke of Bavaria took place, and
what was more important, Charles, Comte de Ponthieu,
youngest son of the King, was betrothed to Marie
d’Anjou, daughter of the King of Sicily, at the Louvre
in presence of the Queen and Princes, the King being
ill at the time.</p>

<p>There was also a talk of marrying the Princess
Catherine, youngest daughter of the King and Queen,
to Henry V. of England.</p>

<p>In February of 1414, with bitterly cold winds
appeared a disease that seems just like the modern
influenza. It was attended by cold, cough, loss of
appetite, violent pains in the head and general
languour. It attacked all classes; judges and lawyers
had to suspend their courts, the malady spread and
was very dangerous.</p>

<p>A foolish step of the Queen’s had just re-opened
the routs and quarrels that always seemed now to
rage amongst the royal family. There were certain
gentlemen in the household of her son, the Duc d’Aquitaine,
whom she distrusted because they had
been placed there by his father-in-law, and she wished
to remove them. She was just then living at the
hôtel St. Paul, and the Duchesse d’Aquitaine with
her; the Duke was at the Louvre. Having consulted
with the Armagnac chiefs, who were silly enough to
countenance her plans, she went suddenly to the
Louvre taking the Duchess with her, seized Jean de
Croy, and three other officers of her son’s household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
and threw them into prison. The Duc d’Aquitaine,
who liked them, flew into a great rage and the princes
could hardly prevent him from rushing out to appeal
to the mob, and could not stop him from writing
secretly to the Duke of Burgundy to come back.</p>

<p>With two such people as Isabeau and her son what
could be done? Jean Sans-peur set off at once with
a body of troops&mdash;but before he could arrive Isabeau
and the princes had contrived to pacify the Duc
d’Aquitaine and persuade him to contradict everything
he had said, and write to the fortified towns proclaiming
the Duke of Burgundy an enemy of the
King. Infuriated by this treatment, the Duke of
Burgundy produced and displayed his son-in-law’s
letters, and continued his march towards Paris, the civil
war beginning again with much cruelty and slaughter.</p>

<p>The domestic quarrels of the royal family were
worse than ever. The old Duc de Berry disputed
the regency during the King’s frequent attacks, with
the Duc d’Aquitaine, just as he and his brother had
done with Louis d’Orléans, and on the same pretence,
his youth and inexperience. Aquitaine was at
daggers drawn with his father-in-law, and so far justified
his great-uncle’s assertions that besides possessing
all the faults of his uncle, Louis d’Orléans and his
father, he had no taste for military affairs, no
attraction or charm, though he was rather good-looking.
He was exceedingly unpopular, hated
appearing in public, and shut himself up all day (when
he was not in bed) playing the harp and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">épinette</i>
with his musical friends. If the King gave him any
business to do he neglected it, and was so ill-tempered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
that he could not bear to be found the least fault
with. Music, horses, and dissipation were all he
cared for. He had now separated from his wife and
reduced her household to a very low estate; he had
always disliked her. Historians say that she gave no
cause whatever for complaint, but that people made
mischief between them.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> The Duke of Burgundy
sent a message requiring him to dismiss La Cassinelle
and take his wife back, which only made him more
angry. He had removed her from his mother’s care
and sent her to St. Germain-en-Laye,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> also seizing
some treasure kept by Isabeau at the houses of confidential
agents, taking advantage of the illness of
the King his father to do as he chose. This was
the beginning of the Queen’s dislike for Armagnac,
who was mixed up in the affair, and her inclining
towards the Burgundian party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1415}</div>

<p>In March, 1415, the Emperor of Germany paid a
visit to the French Court, where he was entertained
with the usual lavish profusion. He, in return, gave
a great banquet at the Louvre to the ladies of the
court and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoises</i> of Paris, “and to each one was
laid a German knife, and the strongest wine that
could be got. And everything was so spiced they
could hardly eat it. There were many minstrels, and
after dinner they danced and some sang. And when
they left to each was given a gold ring, which, however
was not of much value.”<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>When the summer came round the truce with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
England expired. English troops from Calais and
other places began to attack the French provinces,
and it was rumoured that King Henry was gathering
a great host at Southampton to invade France.</p>

<p>It was nearly sixty years since the battle of
Poitiers, and seventy since that of Crécy, and there
were old people alive who could remember the confusion,
dismay, and terror of that time. The Duc de
Berry had himself been in the battle of Poitiers, from
which he had fled; while the Duke of Burgundy, then
a boy of thirteen, had fought to the last beside their
father, King Jean, and been carried prisoner with
him to England.</p>

<p>Times were still more disastrous now. With a
mad King, a worthless heir-apparent, and a number
of princes of the blood without either capacity or
conduct, there were no leaders whom the people
could trust or love, or whom they would follow
and die for as their fathers and grandfathers did for
Philippe de Valois, King Jean, the Duc de Bourbon,
the gallant Princes of Navarre, the heroic King of
Bohemia, or the noble chiefs of the Capétienne house
of Burgundy.</p>

<p>However, it was necessary to make preparations.
Enormous taxes were levied in haste, and everywhere
bands of soldiers were hurrying up to join the army,
and plundering the villages on their way. What the tax
collectors left they carried off, and the people in
terror and despair left their homes and hid in the
woods, longing only that the campaign might be
over, whichever side won.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Charles d’Albret was appointed commander-in-chief,
and all the highest commands were given to
Armagnacs. Jean Sans-peur took no post in the army
at all, and forbade the Comte de Charolais to join;
being, besides politically hostile, resolved not to risk
his only son as had been done to their cost by the
former house of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Early in August the English fleet sailed from
Southampton, and sixteen hundred ships entered the
Seine, passed up between Honfleur and Harfleur, and
landed the troops, who proceeded to invest the latter
town, which was an important commercial place and
the key of Normandy, being a strong fortress surrounded
with deep moats and massive walls and
towers.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> It was bravely defended, but as no help
came from the French army which was slowly
gathering at Vernon, the town surrendered on
September 22nd.</p>

<p>King Henry repaired, provisioned, and garrisoned
the place, and then began his victorious march
through France. Charles, who just then was in his
right mind, came to Rouen with the Duc d’Aquitaine
and the rest of the princes in October, and at a
hurried council it was decided that a battle must be
fought, but that the King and his son should not be
present for fear of a calamity such as befel King Jean
at Poitiers. All over France the nobles were summoned
to join the royal standard with their vassals,
but the princes were stupid enough to refuse a body
of six thousand armed men offered by the city of
Paris whose services they disdained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
The Comte de Charolais, who knew there was going
to be a battle but did not know when, was wild to get
away and join the army. His tutors, however, had
been warned by the terrible Duke of Burgundy that
he made them responsible for his not doing so, and
they were at their wits’ end what to do. They did
not like to tell the young Philippe, lest he should
find some way of circumventing them, and when
a summons arrived for him from the Constable
d’Albret, he declared he would go. He was then at
Arras, and in much perplexity they pretended to
consent, and leaving that city got him to the castle of
Aire, where the Constable again sent several seigneurs
and Montjoye, King-at-arms, to fetch him. As long
as they could the distracted tutors put off his departure,
carefully concealing from him the time when
the battle was to take place, but most of his people
kept escaping secretly to go to the front, and at last
they were obliged to tell him, to appease his anger,
of his father’s orders, which he dared not disobey but
retired to his room in despair and shut himself up
there crying. (“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Moult fort pleurant.</i>”)<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

  <div class="caption">MAN IN ARMOUR, FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</div></div>

<p>The King of England desired to cross by the ford
of Blanchetache, where his great-grandfather, Edward
III., had passed over the river seventy years ago, but
the place was too strongly guarded, so he marched
along the bank for some distance and came up with
the French army which was waiting for him at a
place enclosed with little woods between the villages
of Rousseauville and Azincourt. It was Thursday,
October 24th, about the hour of vespers, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
two armies confronted each other. Philippe, Comte
de Nevers, and several young nobles had just been
knighted by the hand of Boucicault, Marshal of
France. The Constable had arrived with the royal
banner, the Oriflamme.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Around it rose the banners
of the princes, barons, and chevaliers with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
followers who had flocked to the standard of France.
Great fires were lighted, for the night was cold; a
drizzling rain had begun to fall, and they were
waiting for the English army which must pass on its
way to Calais.</p>

<p>The English were hungry and tired with their long
march, but they came up with the sound of trumpets
and martial music, and the heavy tramp of horses
and armed men, so that the earth seemed to tremble
with the echo. Silently and composedly they took
up their perilous position, well aware of the danger
which lay before them, for the French host outnumbered
them by at least three to one, and had a much
larger proportion of cavalry. But they thought of
Crécy and Poitiers, passed the night in attending to
their horses, bows, and armour, and prepared for
death by confessing their sins, and receiving the
Sacrament of the Body of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>The French had scarcely any musical instruments
to rejoice their spirits, and their horses did not neigh,
but made scarcely a sound all night, which many
considered an evil omen. The rain and mud and
cold depressed their spirits which sank lower as
they, too, remembered Crécy and Poitiers. All
night they were calling to each other in the darkness,
and many who had been at enmity made friends
again, forgave each other, embraced, and drank out of
the same cup, as they thought that perhaps they were
about to see the dawn of their last day.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<p>Still, when morning broke and they saw their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
great superiority in numbers and strength, they
gathered confidence, and thought indeed that the
English army could not escape them. And between
nine and ten they advanced to battle, bending their
heads so that the arrows might not pierce through
their visors.</p>

<p>King Henry had heard mass at the break of day,
and then mounting his grey charger had arranged
his troops for the battle, the archers forming the right
and left wings. He rode through the ranks and
harangued the soldiers, pointing out the danger of
their position, from which the only escape was
victory. He reminded them of those other battles in
which their fathers and grandfathers, wearied and
outnumbered, had fought and conquered, and then
dismounting from his horse he placed himself at the
head of the infantry and led the attack. Twice they
halted to take breath, and twice they came on with a
great shout, while a shower of arrows rushed through
the air into the vanguard of the French army. The
English archers were slightly armed and poorly
dressed, but strong and active; they wore an axe or
sword at their girdle and carried a pike to force their
way through the thickest of the fight. In the French
army there was neither order nor discipline. The
King and his sons were not present as at Crécy and
Poitiers, and the princes would obey no other leader.
Those who were not placed in the vanguard refused
to stay with their men but pressed forward to join the
line of cavaliers in heavy armour who bore the
noblest names in France, and stood in the front of
the battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
A squadron of cavalry was ordered to charge;
they were the flower of the French troops. They
came on impetuously at a gallop, but the ground was
soft with deep mud, the horses slipped, floundered,
and became unmanageable, a flight of arrows falling
amongst them added to their confusion, they turned
and fled. Then the English throwing down bows
and pikes, seized their swords and axes and rushed
into the thick of the fight. They broke through the
first division, but when they came to the second and
third there were no leaders, as they had all gone to
the front ranks. The subalterns could not lead the
soldiers, who hesitated, wavered, and at last gave
way, and the battle became a rout. The English
were too few in number to pursue as they dared not
separate, and Henry seeing a troop coming up, and
thinking the enemy were being reinforced, gave the
order to put the prisoners to death, which command
began to be carried out, but presently, seeing that
the troop was also retreating, the King ordered the
massacre to be stopped, which was at once done, but
not before many lives had been sacrificed, and a deep
stain inflicted upon his name.</p>

<p>The English lost sixteen hundred men, including
the Duke of York and Earl of Oxford, but the losses
of the French are said to have been ten thousand
men and fifteen hundred prisoners. Among the dead
were the Duc de Brabant and Comte de Nevers,
brothers of the Duke of Burgundy, the Duc de Bar
and his two brothers, the Constable d’Albret and the
Duc d’Alençon, all nearly related to the King, and
numbers of other nobles and gentlemen. Among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
prisoners were the Ducs d’Orléans and Bourbon, the
Comtes de Richemont and Eu, Marshal Boucicault,
and many others of high degree.</p>

<p>But the army of King Henry was too small and
too exhausted to push its victory any further; in fact,
its safety appeared to him so doubtful that he ordered
all the plunder taken to be burnt, and taking their
prisoners with them the English troops turned their
steps towards Calais and embarked for Dover a week
after the victory.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> The Queen was at Melun when
the news of the disaster arrived. She was ill at the
time, and had also become so stout that she had been
obliged to give up riding, therefore in haste and
consternation she had herself carried in a litter to
Paris, taking with her the Duchesse d’Aquitaine, for
fear of falling into the hands of the Duke of Burgundy,
who directly he heard of the result of the battle and
the losses of the Armagnacs, started for the capital at
the head of ten thousand cavalry. The Queen and
Duchesse d’Aquitaine were at the hôtel d’Orléans,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
and the Duc d’Aquitaine, who now returned in haste
to Paris, went to the hôtel de Bourbon; the King,
the Duc de Berry, and Comte d’Armagnac also hurried
back; the King of Sicily took refuge at Angers, to get
out of the way of Jean Sans-peur, who was his bitter
enemy, because he had first betrothed his son to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
daughter of the latter, a little child, and then changed
his mind and sent her back to her father.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1416}</div>

<p>The Duc d’Aquitaine sent to forbid Burgundy to
advance, and not liking to set his son-in-law at
defiance he arrested his march, but in the midst of
all the anxiety and commotion that was going on,
Louis Duc d’Aquitaine died after a few days’ illness,
having, as had always been foretold, utterly destroyed
his constitution by the excesses of his life. Before
his death he expressed his remorse at his conduct to
his wife.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> Of course there were some who declared
that he had been poisoned, and that Jean Sans-peur
had done it, but as his death prevented the Duke of
Burgundy’s daughter from being Queen of France
this is not at all likely, however angry he might have
been at Aquitaine’s treatment of her and disregard
of his own counsels.</p>

<p>The next Dauphin, Jean Duc de Touraine, lived
with his wife and her family in Hainault, where the
Queen and Council (the King being ill) sent, to desire
him to come at once to Paris. But Jean, brought up
by the near relations and firm allies of Burgundy, was
far more Burgundian than his elder brother, the son-in-law
of Jean Sans-peur. He refused to receive the
deputation except in the presence of the Burgundian
ambassadors, and he would not go to Paris unless
his uncle of Burgundy might go too. Louis
d’Aquitaine had died at the beginning of 1416, and
it was not until early in 1417 that, after much discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
and exchange of letters and messengers he
set off with his father-in-law for Compiègne, as the
Queen absolutely refused to come to St. Quentin as
they wished.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1417}</div>

<p>They established themselves in the royal palace of
Compiègne, where they were joined by the Dauphine
and Comtesse de Hainault, and where they lived in
state and splendour as Jean always had done, for the
Hainaults were very rich. Jacqueline was their
only child, and they were exceedingly proud of the
alliance with the son of the King, especially now
he had become Dauphin. He was now eighteen,
and seems to have had more constancy of purpose
than his brother, but to have been entirely under
the influence of the Comte de Hainault and Duke of
Burgundy. What he was really like is impossible
to say. De Mézeray calls him “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">un jeune homme
capriceux, acriastre, déplaisant en mœurs et façons</i>.”
Juvenal des Ursins and Paradin observe that it was
a pity he did not live to be King, as he had been well
brought up and taught by the Comte de Hainault
who was a wise prince. The monk of St. Denis
declares that he was a noble character, but he
generally appears to have had that opinion of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>. It was very likely that he was better
than his eldest brother, as he easily might have
been. He was extravagant and magnificent like
all his family, and those who surrounded him
and had charge of his education were always
praising his lavish generosity and inciting him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
hold a more brilliant court than his parents the
King and Queen.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>That the Dauphin and Dauphine lived in great
splendour at Compiègne is proved by many of the bills
and accounts still existing, the costly stuffs of their
dresses, the magnificent plate and jewels, and the
presents they made to each other and to the members
of their households. Messengers went perpetually
between Compiègne, Senlis, Paris, and other places
to fetch things and to carry letters. There is a
record of a sum paid to the Provost of Senlis for
having escorted “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour la doubte et péril des chemins</i>,” a
sum of money from Senlis to Compiègne. Sums of
money are also given to the King’s minstrels, to the
choristers of the Dauphin’s chapel, and to Hennequin
who takes care of his pet dogs; also for tapestry
hangings for his room, nine pieces, with a stag hunt
and boat hunt on green worked with silk, gold, and
silver.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>Isabeau must have been estranged from the son
who had been so separated from her; for we find
that when she came to Senlis with her youngest son
Charles, who had been made Duc de Touraine,
Governor of Paris, and Duc de Berry (the old Duke
having just died), although the Dauphine was taken
there to pay her homage, and spent some hours with
her “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en grande léeses</i>,” Isabeau returned to Paris with
the Comte de Hainault without seeing the Dauphin.
Possibly she may have been irritated against him, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
he still refused to come to Paris, now in the hands of
the Armagnacs, and demanded the regency during
the King’s malady.</p>

<p>But amongst the schemes, disputes, and rivalry of
the two parties, one of which put its trust in the
Dauphin, and the other fixed its hopes on his brother,
the Duc de Touraine, then between fourteen and
fifteen years old&mdash;a sudden change raised the spirits
of the one and filled the other with dismay. The
Dauphin began to be ill. Doctors were sent for; we
read of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevaucheurs</i>” sent to ride “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haste hastivement</i>”
to fetch fruit and medicines from Paris; and prayers
and masses said and sung in chapels and convents
for his recovery.</p>

<p>Early in April the Comte de Hainault, secretly
warned that he would be arrested by the Armagnacs,
escaped early in the morning from Paris on pretence
of a pilgrimage to St. Maur-des-fossés, in the forest
of Vincennes, from whence he rode in haste to
Compiègne. But he found the Dauphin ill in bed
“with a swollen body and other symptoms of poison,”
according to some historians, or, as others say, with
an abscess in the ear. At any rate he died in a few
days,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> and there was an outcry of poison, perhaps
with more probability than usual, for he had not
ruined his health like his brother, and though it could
be nothing but an outrageous calumny that the
Queen had done it by means of a gold chain she
sent him, it was more likely that if there had been
foul play at all it came from the Armagnacs who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
everything to gain by the death of the Burgundian
Jean and the succession of the Armagnac Charles,
the son-in-law of the King of Sicily and bitter enemy
of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Isabeau was certainly most unlucky in her relations
with her sons. Three of them died in early childhood,
with Louis she latterly had frequent quarrels, Jean
was estranged from her; but the unnatural strife and
hatred between her and her remaining son Charles
was the crown of all the calamities of her reign. It
seems to have been caused in the first place by
Armagnac, who, in consequence of the death soon
after each other of the King’s two elder sons, the
Duc de Berry, the King of Sicily, and the Comte de
Hainault, had become exceedingly powerful and, the
only person whose power and influence might stand
in his way being the Queen, proceeded to make
mischief between her, the Dauphin, a weak, characterless
boy, and the King, whose mind was now more
clouded and his intellect feebler during the intervals
between the attacks of his terrible malady.</p>

<p>Added to all this, the King of England threatened
that he would soon be in Paris and there were
hurried preparations to resist him. All the places
that lay on the road by which he would pass were
strengthened, moats deepened, walls repaired,
batteries of wood and stone made, and stores of
provisions laid in. St. Denis was especially fortified,
and the monks had to contribute largely to the
defence fund, for which purpose they were obliged to
sell two large gold crowns and a quantity of silver
plate. The holy relics, including the body of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Denis, were taken by some of the monks to Paris and
hidden in a safe but secular place, which, however,
caused so much scandal that they had to be brought
back again; and the monk who writes of this time
says that for eleven months the trumpets of the
enemy were continually in their ears.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>The Queen was holding her court at Vincennes
and had placed in command of the troops who acted
as her guards, Louis de Bosredon, and the Sires de
Graville and Giac, dissolute young nobles, who spent
enormous sums of money and passed their time in
feasting, revelry, and in carrying on intrigues with the
Queen’s ladies, and, it was rumoured, even with the
Queen herself. At least it was said by Armagnac and
his party, to whose interest it was to circulate such
a report, and who succeeded in making the Dauphin
and the King, who then had a lucid interval, believe
the story. Being at the same time weak and violent,
and so, as is always the case, more dangerous and
mischievous than a person who, though violent, is
also strong, they listened to the words of Armagnac,
and the King riding in haste one evening to
Vincennes, passed Bosredon, who instead of dismounting
according to the usual etiquette, saluted
slightly and rode on. This put a finishing stroke to
the anger of Charles, who ordered him to be arrested.
He was put to the “<em>question</em>” or torture, and was said
to have made compromising confessions respecting
the Queen. He was thrown into the Seine and
drowned; the other young nobles escaped. It is very
likely, whatever admissions were wrung by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
iniquitous means from Bosredon, that he was not
guilty; as to Isabeau she was about forty-seven years
old, had grown fat, and was suffering from gout,
which circumstances make such an accusation as far
as she was concerned highly improbable, though the
disorders of her court were doubtless deplorable.
However, the conspiracy had succeeded, she was sent
to Tours with the Duchess of Bavaria her sister-in-law,
and not allowed as she wished, to go to Melun,
where she had much treasure, a great deal of which
was seized by the Dauphin, and the part he took in
this outrage aroused in the Queen that undying hatred
which caused such disaster to him and to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1418}</div>

<p>It would have been better for the Dauphin Charles
if he had let his mother and her friends and her
treasure alone, for Isabeau, though capricious and
foolish, was not a woman to submit tamely to such
an outrage as this. And Jean Sans-peur was neither
capricious, foolish, nor weak, and it was to him that
her thoughts turned in this crisis.</p>

<p>For about six months Isabeau led an intolerable
life at Tours in close captivity, guarded by Jean
Picard, who had been her own secretary, and had
betrayed to the Dauphin the existence of a collection
of gold, silver, pearls, and diamonds which she had
entrusted to the keeping of the Abbot of St. Denis;
Guillaume Toreau, her chancellor, and Laurent du
Puy, whom she hated more than any of them, as he
prevented her from writing or receiving letters without
his leave and treated her with disrespect, even
speaking to her without taking his hat off.</p>

<p>She managed however to send a secret message to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the Duke of Burgundy with her seal. Jean Sans-peur
was besieging Corbeil, but he knew that the Queen
was worth more to him than the possession of that or
any other town, so he raised the siege and rode day
and night to Tours where he arrived on the Feast of
All Souls.</p>

<p>The Queen meanwhile had signified her intention
of performing her devotions at the abbey of Marmoutiers
on the banks of the Loire, near Tours. The
three gaolers did not venture to object to this act
of religion. While prayers were going on they
approached the Queen and said that a great company
of Burgundians and English were close at hand.
Just then Hector de Saveuse, lieutenant of the Duke
of Burgundy, having posted armed men all round,
entered the church and saluted the Queen in the
name of his master who was close at hand. Isabeau
pointed to her three gaolers saying, “Arrest these
three men.” This was immediately done, but Laurent
du Puy, who knew it was all over with him, broke
away, ran down to the Loire, tried to jump into
a boat that lay moored to the shore, fell into the
water and was drowned. In two hours the Queen
and the Duke of Burgundy had met and become reconciled;
the Queen assumed the regency, and under
the powerful escort of the Duke of Burgundy, having
been recognised by the authorities of Tours, made a
progress through central France with her ladies, and
fixed her court and parliament at Troyes. She had a
seal engraved with the arms of France and Bavaria
and issued proclamations beginning, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Isabelle, par la
grace de Dieu Royne de France</i>.” The civil war now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
raged as fiercely as ever, and the English had
conquered most of Normandy and were besieging
Rouen.</p>

<p>In May, 1418, a party of young men, partisans of
the Queen and Burgundy, led by Perrinet le Clerc,
whose father kept the keys of the porte S. Germain-des-Près,
went to Seigneur de L’Isle Adam, and
offered to admit the Burgundian troops by night into
Paris. It was arranged that the latter should be at
the gate with eight hundred men, and Perrinet should
contrive to steal the keys from his father who always
kept them under his pillow, and who would have distrusted
any one rather than his son. With a band of
the conspirators Perrinet crept secretly in the darkness
to the Porte St. Germain and awaited the coming
of the soldiers. It was nearly two hours after midnight
when the gate was unlocked, L’Isle Adam
and his troops in order of battle passed stealthily
through, and Perrinet le Clerc locked the gate
behind them and threw the keys over the wall into
the moat, while the Burgundians began their silent
march through the dark, narrow streets, no word
being spoken until they stood before the Châtelet
where a body of four hundred armed men waited for
them, and then began the attack on the houses of the
Armagnacs with a sudden rush amid cries for the
King and Burgundy. Forcing their way to the
palace they seized the King, induced him to grant
all their demands and rode away with him. Armagnac
escaped in disguise; Tanneguy du Chastel, provost of
Paris, aroused by the noise and tumult, hastened to
the hôtel of the Dauphin, wrapped him in a cloak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
and hurried him and the Dauphine into the Bastille
where some of their party had taken refuge. Doors
were flung open, people rushed out of their houses
with arms in their hands, torches gleamed and cries
resounded in the streets, plunder, fighting, and
slaughter went on all night, and in the morning both
King and capital were in the hands of the Burgundians.
Armagnac was betrayed by the man who had sheltered
him and carried off to prison; Tanneguy du Chastel
escaped with the Dauphin to Corbeil and thence to
Melun; the town was given up to violence, pillage,
and murder; the Armagnacs fled in confusion; and the
Duke of Burgundy went to Troyes and brought back
the Queen in triumph. All the chiefs of the
Burgundian party came to meet them with six
hundred of the principal citizens, bringing velvet
robes covered with crosses of St. Andrew for Burgundy
and his nephew which they put on to enter Paris.
The Queen was seated on a “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">char</i>,” the streets so
lately running with blood were strewn with flowers,
and the King received the Queen with affection
and satisfaction.</p>

<p>But very soon the approach of the English army
compelled them to take refuge at Troyes, while a
dreadful pestilence was ravaging the country. The
Abbot of St. Denis died, and many other people of
importance. Many fled from the country, and for
four months there was a dreadful mortality.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> The
Duke of Burgundy was now declared Captain of Paris
instead of the Dauphin, who remained at Bourges.
The King, Queen, and Princess Catherine were completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
under the influence of Burgundy, whose eldest
son was, it will be remembered, married to another
daughter of the King, and whose aim now was to get
the Dauphin also under his guidance, which did not
seem to be at all impossible, Charles being only
fifteen, and having no more brains, capacity, nor
decision of character than his brother Louis; being
absolutely guided by whoever he was with, and at
present surrounded by persons of no particular rank
or weight. The young Comte de Clermont, son of
the Duc de Bourbon, who was about the age of the
Dauphin and had just returned from captivity in
England, had come over to the Burgundians, saying
that wherever the King was, there was his place, and
it was hoped the Dauphin would do the same.
Armagnac was dead, and his chief counsellor was
Tanneguy du Chastel, a Breton gentleman. Burgundy
had sent his young wife Marie d’Anjou back to him
and was anxious for a reconciliation.</p>

<p>The English conquests were spreading. Rouen
was besieged and taken, and though negotiations
were going on for the marriage of the Princess
Catherine, Henry V. demanded as her dowry all the
provinces conceded to his great-grandfather by the
peace of Bretigny, to which the King and Duke of
Burgundy would not agree.</p>

<p>As the King and Queen started to take the
Princess Catherine to meet Henry V. at Pontoise,
however, the King was seized with an attack of
frenzy, so he had to be left there while the Duke of
Burgundy went on to Melun with the Queen and
Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Henry V. met them, and at once fell in love with
the Princess who was just nineteen and extremely
beautiful; but he would not come to terms about the
dowry, and Isabeau, thinking to inflame his passion
for her, only let them meet once and then sent her
back to Pontoise. However, this only infuriated
Henry, who told Burgundy that he would have the
Princess and the lands too, in spite of them, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">et je
vous chasseray de France, vous et vostre Roy</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>The negotiations not having resulted in much
good the King desired the Dauphin and Duke of
Burgundy to make peace. The Duc de Bretagne
went to and fro between the Dauphin, his brother-in-law,
and the Queen and Burgundy. “Everywhere
there was a great longing for the success of the
arrangements for there was great desolation in all
parts of the kingdom for the war was of father
against son, brother against brother, uncle against
nephew. And the worst was when in one town were
held the two factions of Burgundy and Armagnac,
and thieves and robbers were everywhere and
merchandise always and everywhere lost.”<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>It was difficult enough to persuade the Dauphin to
agree to terms, but the Queen sent the Dame de
Giac, an old lady the Dauphin had been very fond of
from his childhood, and who was said to have been
at one time the mistress of the Duke of Burgundy,
to Pouilly where the conference was going on. She
went from one tent to the other and managed so to
arrange matters as to bring about a reconciliation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
The Dauphin, who, though he had no sense, had
very pleasant manners, showed great courtesy to the
Duke and when they separated frantic rejoicings
took place at Paris, bells ringing, feasting in the
streets, singing and dancing going on all night
long.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1419}</div>

<p>But, as at the marriage festivities of Richard II.
and Isabelle, a great storm came on during the conference,
“and,” says the monk of St. Denis, “the
heavens were black with clouds, there was thunder
and lightning and torrents of rain and huge hailstones
which destroyed the vines and crops. Some said
this storm arose from natural causes, but it was most
generally believed that the evil spirits could sometimes
produce these disorders and that perhaps the
interviews of the princes were disagreeable to them.
Therefore people did not believe in the stability or
durability of the treaty concluded. It was also the
opinion of several of the learned astrologers. For
my part I leave their judgment to Him who reigns
in the heavens.”<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>The truce with England expired and the war
broke out again. The English troops took many
towns and castles, the Duke of Burgundy retired
with the King and Queen to Troyes, and no adequate
measures were taken against the enemy. The Dauphin
returned from Touraine in September, and sent
Tanneguy du Chastel to Troyes to ask for another
conference with the Duke of Burgundy, who at first
refused, saying that there was peace between them
and the Dauphin had much better come to Troyes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
his father and mother. However, he allowed himself
to be persuaded and consented to meet the Dauphin
at Montereau, in spite of the entreaties and warnings
of his own friends and followers who dreaded the
vengeance of the Armagnacs for all his deeds,
from the murder of Louis d’Orléans to the late
massacres of their friends and relations in Paris,
besides their fear of his gaining over the Dauphin
the influence he already possessed over the King and
Queen.</p>

<p>The interview was to take place on the bridge of
Montereau, to which the Duke of Burgundy rode on
the 10th of September, about three in the afternoon.
As he dismounted to go on to the bridge, three of his
servants who had been upon it examining the barrier
across it, which they did not like the look of, came
up to him and again begged him not to risk himself
on it, but it was no use. At the barrier in the
middle of the bridge he met the Dauphin, the one
through which he himself passed having been locked
behind him. After a few words of conversation, the
Dauphin, as the Duke knelt before him, began to
reproach him with having done nothing to oppose
the English. At that moment one of the Armagnacs
pushed him from behind, Burgundy laid his hand on
his sword which had got behind him to pull it
forward. Robert de Loir, who had pushed him,
exclaimed, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mettez-vous la main à vostre épée en la
présence de Monseigneur le Dauphin?</i>” Tanneguy
du Chastel approached, made a sign, and saying “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il
est temps</i>” struck the Duke with an axe. He tried to
draw his sword but it was too late, there was a cry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tuez! tuez!</i>” a fierce scuffle; then Jean Sans-peur
lay dead at the feet of the Dauphin, and Louis
d’Orléans was avenged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1420}</div>

<p>The rage, consternation, and mischief caused by
this event throughout the country, just as every one
thought there was going to be a little peace, cannot
be described. The Queen and her son-in-law
Philippe, Comte de Charolais, now Duke of Burgundy,
prepared to take their revenge. Philippe,
overwhelmed with grief, would scarcely see or speak
to any one for days. To his wife he said, “Michelle,
your brother has murdered my father”; and then
finding that she was fretting and making herself
miserable fearing to lose his affection he comforted
and reassured her. The Queen and Duke of Burgundy
sent proclamations to all the chief towns in
France denouncing the Dauphin for the murder of
Jean Sans-peur; and made a treaty with the King of
England at Troyes, by which they agreed that he
should marry the Princess Catherine and not only
act as regent of France during the King’s illnesses
but succeed to the crown to the exclusion of the
Dauphin.</p>

<p>Isabeau, who was then at Troyes, sent the Bishop
of Arras secretly to Henry to invite him to come
there, and to take him a love-letter from the Princess
Catherine, with which he was delighted.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> The young
princess was deeply in love with Henry V. and very
anxious to be Queen of England, and had all along
persuaded her mother, whose great favourite she was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
to help her in the matter and forward the alliance.
Isabeau was glad enough to do so for she loved her
daughter and hated her son, and this marriage fell in
with her views regarding them both. The wedding
was celebrated at Troyes, June 3, 1420, with extraordinary
magnificence. The Kings and Queens of
France and England and the young Duke of
Burgundy entered Paris, and spent Christmas there;
after which Henry and Catherine went on a visit to
England. The young Queen seems to have felt
bitterly the separation from her parents and country;
an ancient chronicle says of her: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Item, ce jour party
la fille de France nommée Catherine que le roy
d’Engleterre avoit espousée et fut menée en Engleterre,
et fut une piteuse départie, especialement du roy de
France et de sa fille.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1422}</div>

<p>Just before Christmas, 1421, came the news of the
birth of a son to the King and Queen of England.
In Paris as in London bells rang and bonfires blazed
in the streets; for the child, afterwards the unfortunate
Henry VI., was born the heir of both England
and France. The winter was an unusually cold one,
the frost being so severe that no corn could be
ground except in windmills, all the watermills being
frozen up.</p>

<p>In May, 1422, Queen Catherine came back escorted
in great pomp by a great body of English troops.
She arrived at Vincennes, where she stayed some
weeks with her parents and husband who received
her, as an ancient chronicler observes, “as if she had
been an angel.” The court kept Whitsuntide at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Paris, Charles VI. and Isabeau at the hôtel St. Paul,
Henry V. and Catherine at the Louvre. The people
thronged to see the great banquets at which the
King and Queen of England feasted in splendid
robes, crowns, and jewels; while those of the King
and Queen of France were neglected, and at neither
were food and wine given away according to ancient
custom, which caused much discontent. But these
were the last great fêtes of the French court in the
reigns of Charles and Henry. In the following
August the King of England, who had for some time
been suffering from a dangerous and, in those days,
incurable malady, died at Vincennes, and his death
was followed in October by that of Charles VI. at
the hôtel St. Paul. Henry died at thirty-six, in the
midst of a brilliant and victorious career King of
England and almost King of France, leaving a
widow of twenty-one overwhelmed with grief, an infant
heir to two kingdoms, and a nation in mourning.
Charles, whose reign began so magnificently, passed
away in the half-deserted palace of St. Paul.
Although Isabeau was living there at the time, only
his confessor, almoner, and the first gentleman of his
household were with him when he died, at the age of
fifty-three.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1423}</div>

<p>The Queen does not seem to have been present at
the funeral, the Dauphin was an exile and an enemy,
and the chief mourner was the Duke of Bedford,
Regent of France for Henry of Lancaster. The
funeral waited till his arrival at Paris and there was
much dispute as to what the arrangements should
be, it having been so long since a King of France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
had been buried that very few people remembered,
and there were no records on the subject.</p>

<p>The litter was so constructed, that it could be
made narrower to pass through the doors of St. Paul,
Notre Dame, and the narrow streets, and widened in
the broader thoroughfares. On it was placed the
coffin covered with a pall of cloth of gold and scarlet
with deep border of blue velvet embroidered with
golden <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>, which fell down to the ground.
It was surmounted by an image of the King dressed
in royal robes, with mantle of ermine, crown, and
sceptre. The litter was carried by the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">varlets</i>” of
the King and followed by two hundred gentlemen of
his household in black, bearing torches and shields
with the arms of France. Next came the mendicant
orders, Jacobins, Carmelites, Cordeliers, and Augustins,
then the colleges, parochial clergy, ecclesiastics
of the collegiate churches and university, bishops,
abbots and nobles, members of Parliament, the four
presidents in mantles of scarlet and vair holding the
four corners of the pall, the King’s chamberlain,
esquires, and many of the chief citizens; the Duke of
Bedford, Regent of France, rode behind the litter.
The streets and windows were crowded with people
mourning and lamenting, and so, at the hour of
vespers the body of Charles le Bien-aimé was carried
to Notre Dame. The church was hung with costly
stuffs covered with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>, and blazing with
torches, the psalms and vigils for the dead were
chanted “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">et fut nuict</i>.” Next morning, after mass,
the procession formed again and the body was carried
in state to St. Denis, where all night the monks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
chanted psalms and vigils for the dead; and then
next day, after a magnificent requiem, Charles VI.
was buried by his father and mother, and through
the dim aisles and cloister of the great abbey
resounded the cry, “Pray for the soul of the most
excellent prince, Charles VI., King of France.”</p>

<p>After the religious rites were over the Duke of
Bedford dined in his own room, but there was a great
dinner in the vast hall of the abbey to which
crowded prelates, nobles, gentlemen, and officials,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maîtres d’hôtel</i> restraining those who were pressing to
the chief table and had no right there, and alms
being distributed while the banquet was going on to
more than five thousand poor people.</p>

<p>Isabeau survived her husband twelve years, but
this latter part of her life contains scarcely anything
of sufficient interest to record. After the death of
her son-in-law Henry V., with whom she always got
on well, the departure of her daughter Catherine for
England, and the death of Charles VI., she lived in
the half-deserted palace of St. Paul with a diminished
household and shattered fortune. Her daughter the
Duchess of Burgundy died in 1423, and of her twelve
children there only remained the son she hated, the
Queen of England, now far away, and her second
and third daughters, Jeanne, Duchesse de Bretagne,
and Marie, Prioress of Poissy, whom it is to be
supposed she sometimes saw.</p>

<p>Her brother, Ludwig of Bavaria, also survived her.
But war and famine and pestilence had devastated
the kingdom. Grass grew in the streets of Paris,
and wolves came and attacked children outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
walls and even within the city.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> One event of interest
happened in 1431, which was the state entry of
her grandson Henry VI. into Paris. While Isabeau
stood at the window of the hôtel St. Paul watching
the pageant, the child looked up at her as he rode
by, and, some one saying to him, “That is the Queen-dowager
of France, your grandmother,” he took off
his cap and saluted her. At the sight of the young
King, the son of her favourite daughter, riding as
she herself had done amid the acclamations of the
people through the streets which had once been
decorated and thronged to do her honour, Isabeau
burst into tears and turned from the window. The
King, then ten years old, afterwards went to visit his
grandmother at the hôtel St. Paul.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1435}</div>

<p>Isabeau died there in 1435, September 29th. She
had a favourite old German lady who lived with her
to the last and with her other ladies followed her
funeral <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> to Notre Dame on the 13th of
October. Very little pomp was displayed on that
occasion, but the clergy of that cathedral came in
procession to St. Paul, and spared nothing to make
the office worthy of a sovereign, lending a crown,
sceptre, and other royal ornaments. There were
present the Chancellor of France, the Bishop of
Paris, and certain French and English nobles. After
the ceremony the body was placed in a boat by the
presidents of Parliament and taken to St. Denis to
be buried by her husband Charles VI.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Paris was still in possession of the English, but
just before the Queen’s death the treaty of Arras
was signed between the Duke of Burgundy and
Charles VII.</p>

perhaps worst of the sons of King Jean. Although
she was exceedingly beautiful, and in many ways
gifted, she had no influence with Charles VII.,
whom she had married as a child, when, his elder
brothers being alive, there appeared no prospect
of his becoming King. After his accession he constantly
neglected her for Agnes Sorel and other
mistresses. She seems not to have been wanting
in judgment or capacity, and under different circumstances
might have made an excellent queen;
but her idea of duty was the submission of a slave,
and her gentle, saintly character was more fitted for
the cloister than the throne. She was the only human
being her son, Louis XI., really loved,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> and would
never oppose, and her death soon after his accession

<p>Charlotte de Savoie was much less gifted and
more unfortunate than her predecessor. Charles
VII., with all his faults, was neither cruel, avaricious,
nor disagreeable, and his wife was free to amuse
herself and direct her children and household as
she pleased. But Louis XI. was a cruel, remorseless
tyrant, and the only consolation of the unfortunate
Charlotte de Savoie was that she seldom saw him.
She lived in seclusion and with little state at Loches
and Amboise, and when his death gave her freedom
she was already in bad health, and only survived him
for a few months. Of her six children only three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
lived to grow up: Charles VIII., Anne de Beaujeu,
Regent of France, and Jeanne, the deformed wife of

<p>Their mother died in 1485, leaving the children
under the care of Françoise de Dinan, Dame de
Laval, a member of one of the greatest families of
Bretagne, who had been their governess from their
infancy. They continued to be brought up at the
court of their father, who seems to have kept them
constantly with him, but whose affection for them did
not prevent his promising them to anybody whose
alliance he thought might be useful to him amidst
the difficulties and dangers he had brought upon the
duchy which had been so prosperous when he
succeeded to it.</p>

<p>Always under the influence of some unworthy
favourite, he had for many years been governed by
Antoinette de Maignelais, Dame de Villequier, niece
of Agnes Sorel, and her successor in the affections of
Charles VII. After his death she carried on a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">liaison</i> with François, which embittered the life of
his first wife, daughter of the last Duc de Bretagne,
so that the people declared that his having no son to
succeed him was a punishment from heaven for his
conduct.</p>

<p>Anne, as the heiress of Bretagne, was of especial
importance, and proposals for her marriage and her
sister’s with the King of the Romans, the young sons
of Edward IV. of England, the Infant of Spain, or
some of the chief Breton nobles, were perpetually
being entertained.</p>

<p>Some French writers have originated a romantic
story of love between Anne and Louis, Duc d’Orléans,
who had quarrelled with Charles VIII. and his sister,
the Regent,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> and was a great deal at the court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Bretagne. But as Anne was from eight to eleven
years old at that time, by comparing dates and details
given by early chroniclers, it becomes evident that this
was not possible, and that if Louis, who was then
from two to five and twenty, thought of such a child
at all, it could only be as the heiress of Bretagne. He
was, like his grandfather, the brother of Charles VI.,
always involved in some love affair, besides being
already married to Jeanne, the deformed daughter
of Louis XI., who had forced the marriage upon him
in childhood, notwithstanding his opposition and that
of his parents,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> Charles Duc d’Orléans and Marie de
Clèves, hoping thereby to extinguish that branch of
the family. And, notwithstanding his aversion to
his wife, he could not get rid of her whilst her brother
was King and her sister Regent of France.</p>

<p>Jeanne, Duchesse d’Orléans, was greatly to be
pitied. She loved Louis as Valentine Visconti had
loved his still handsomer and more dissipated grandfather.
But Valentine was a brilliant, attractive
woman of the world, with whom the Duke, in spite
of his frequent infidelities, had got on very well.
Jeanne, besides being deformed, was a meek, ascetic
person, whose life had been passed in slavish submission
to her father, the terrible Louis XI., and
despairing love for her husband; her tastes and ideas
were those of the cloister.</p>

<p>Although his follies were the cause of many
calamities to the duchy, François II. was very
popular, he was good-looking and pleasant,
encouraged art, literature, and commerce, and spent
his money freely.</p>

<p>The greatest danger in which he involved the
State arose from his constant enmity to France,
whose fugitives he protected, and whose enemies he
encouraged and assisted on all occasions; and from
the credulous weakness which placed him always
under the influence of some objectionable person.
Antoinette de Maignelais died in 1475, but still
more fatal was his infatuation for one Landais, a
man of obscure birth and abominable character,
whom he made his treasurer, and whose crimes and
cruelties so exasperated the Bretons that they rose in
rebellion, surrounded the palace with threats and
cries, and demanded that he should be given up to
them. The Comte de Foix tried to appease them,
but returned in haste, exclaiming, “I would rather be
Prince over a million wild boars than over such people
as your Bretons; you will certainly have to give up
your treasurer, or we shall all be murdered.”<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>
Landais was accordingly tried, condemned, and
executed, but the harm he had done and the
disastrous state of affairs still remained.</p>

<p>The young English princes having been murdered
by their uncle, Richard III., the Vicomte de Rohan
wanted to marry the two princesses to his two sons;
other suitors also presented themselves, of whom the
one specially detested by Anne was Alain, Comte
d’Albret, brother of her governess, the Dame de
Laval. He was a widower of forty-five, rough, ugly,
disagreeable, ill-tempered, and the father of eight
legitimate and four illegitimate children. A more
preposterous husband for the young princess could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
not have been thought of; notwithstanding which, the
Dame de Laval used all her influence in his favour.
But her persuasions were useless. Anne could not
bear the sight of him, and would not listen. Besides
her personal dislike to him, she said his position was
far beneath her. She wanted to marry a King, or the
son of a King, not a mere Breton noble who was her
father’s subject and would be her own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1488}</div>

<p>There was, however, a strong party who, desiring
that their future duchess should marry a Breton and
stay in her own country, supported the pretensions of
Albret, and so harassed the Duke, her father, that in
order to gain allies and help in his difficulties, he
consented to this monstrous sacrifice, and desired her
to accept him. Anne resisted, but she was then a
child of eleven or twelve years of age, and when her
father, whom she loved, used reproaches, commands,
entreaties, and assured her that the marriage was
necessary to the welfare of the country she adored,
he succeeded in wringing a reluctant consent from
her.</p>

<p>But shortly afterwards he was beaten by the
French at St. Aubin, and after signing a treaty giving
up Dol, St. Malo, and other important towns, and
promising not to marry either of his daughters without
permission of Charles VIII., he fell ill and died
in September, 1488.</p>

<p>The Princess Anne, now Duchess de Bretagne,
was not quite thirteen years old, but in capacity and
character far beyond her age. She was well educated,
understood Latin and Greek, and wrote very good
letters. One to Maximilian of Austria, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
account of the war, the troubles in Bretagne, and the
battle of St. Aubin is quoted as a surprising production
for one so young. But Anne was full of
talent and high spirit, her faults and good qualities
were those of a noble nature. Brave, proud, impetuous,
imperious, passionately attached to her
own country, loving her friends and hating her
enemies with all her heart, always to be relied on,
yielding only to the commands of the Church, or the
good of her own Bretagne, a woman to be loved,
admired, sometimes feared, but never despised or
distrusted.</p>

<p>The Duke left his daughters under the guardianship
of the Maréchal de Rieux and the Comte de Comminges,
who were also to consult Dunois, son of the
famous Bastard of Orléans, and Madame de Laval
was to remain their governess.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> She must have been
fond of them and good to them in spite of her reprehensible
partisanship of her unsuitable brother, for
Anne always showed her much affection.</p>

<p>The princesses were taken immediately from
Coiron, where the Duke died, to Guérande, which
was considered safer. The Breton nobles had sworn
allegiance to Anne in her father’s lifetime, among
others her natural brother, François Baron d’Avaugour,
son of Antoinette de Maignelais. He and
Anne were very fond of each other.</p>

<p>An embassy was sent to the King of France and
the States hastily summoned. Anne sat at the head
of the Council, and her ministers soon discovered that
she was no weak, timid girl of whom they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
dispose at their pleasure, but a high-spirited princess
who knew very well that she was their sovereign.</p>

<p>When Rieux brought forward again the project of
marrying her to the detested Albret as the best way
out of the present difficulties, she immediately, with
an eloquence and decision that astonished them,
rejected the proposal. An historian remarks, “And
the high heart that she had! girl as she was!”<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p>She said that Albret had not even fulfilled the
conditions which alone had induced
her to consent to such an
engagement, in giving assistance
to her father, who had
never desired nor approved of
the marriage, but had been
tormented into consenting when
in weak health by Madame de
Laval, that she had always protested
against it, and that Albret
knew he was repugnant to her,
and that she never meant to
carry it out. That she was the Duchesse de Bretagne
and the greatest heiress in Christendom, that the
idea of trying to force her to marry against her will
was contrary to all propriety, and that sooner than
make such a marriage as this she would retire into a
convent and take the veil.</p>

  <div class="caption">Anne de Bretagne</div></div>

<p>She hated Albret all the more, because as she grew
older and increased in beauty, he had conceived a
violent passion for her, but her courage and firmness
put a stop to the tyrannical meddling of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
ministers and filled them with respect and admiration.</p>

<p>She then sent a messenger to England claiming
the protection of Henry VII.</p>

<p>Her chancellor, Montauban, supported her, considering
the match far beneath her, and told Albret
plainly of the aversion and indignation of the Duchess
and the preposterous nature of his claims. The
Comte d’Albret flew into a furious rage, but was of
course powerless in the matter. And just then
Charles VIII. sent to claim the wardship of the
Duchess and her sister, saying that he would marry
them to the two sons of the Vicomte de Rohan and
resign all his claims to the duchy.</p>

<p>But the Bretons, who hated the Rohans because
they were considered friends to France and traitors
to Bretagne, would not hear of this; Louis d’Orléans
was in prison at Bourges, help did not come from
England, and the friends of the Duchess, including
the Maréchal de Rieux, who saw that it was hopeless
to think of the Comte d’Albret, proposed the eldest
son of the Emperor Maximilian, King of the Romans,
who had been already suggested as a possible husband
for her during the lifetime of her father, and to whom
she had no objection. For, although Maximilian was
also a widower and a great deal older than herself,
he was a handsome, courteous, pleasant man in the
prime of life, and could give her the most splendid
position in Europe.</p>

<p>The duchy was by this time in a condition equally
deplorable and dangerous. Charles VIII., exasperated
at the English and other foreign troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
being called in, made vigorous war upon Bretagne,
town after town was besieged and taken by his army.
Alain d’Albret continued to put forth his claims on
the young Duchess, declaring that he had her father’s
promise and her own consent, but ignoring the fact
that this consent had been wrung from a weak and
almost dying man, and a child of ten years old, who
directly she was free had made a public protest
against this arbitrary act. Madame de Laval for a
long time continued her advocacy of her brother’s
cause, while Anne steadily persisted that she would
take the veil sooner than marry him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1489}</div>

<p>Meanwhile she waited anxiously for help from
England, but Henry VII., unwilling to make war on
France, lost a great deal of time in correspondence
with the French King, hoping to arrange matters by
this means. But the war went on, and the young
Duchess fled from one town to another, and at
length, finding herself in an unsafe position in the
unfortified town of Rhédon, with her sister, where
there was a great chance of being taken by the
French, sent to her guardians, Rieux and Comminges,
to come up with the troops and escort them to
Nantes. There was no time to lose, for the French
were in the neighbourhood, and the place could not
be defended.</p>

<p>The princesses were waiting in great anxiety when
they were told that Rieux and Comminges had both
gone to Nantes, where they had joined Albret.
Anne was very angry, all the more as she suspected
that they would try to influence the people against
her and her friends by making them believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Dunois intended to deliver up both her and the town
to the King of France. She set off from Rhédon on
horseback with Isabelle and the Chancellor Montauban,
with a bodyguard of ten Bretons as an escort,
and rode to La Pasquelay, about three leagues from
Nantes, where she was joined by Dunois at the head
of some troops. She sent a message to Nantes
ordering the gates to be opened for her entry, but the
reply was that she was welcome to enter with her
household and private guards, but not with Montauban,
Dunois, or the troops; and seeing that the
plan was to throw her into the power of Rieux and
Albret, she angrily refused, upon which they marched
out of the town with a large force to compel her to
enter as they proposed. With undaunted courage
Anne mounted on horseback behind Montauban and
rode forward, while Dunois and the troops prepared
for battle. But the townspeople no sooner saw her
than they forbade any force to be used against her,
but obliged the nobles to go back into the town. For
some days negotiations went on, but Anne sent word
that she would only enter Nantes as its sovereign,
and turning away after a perilous journey took
refuge at Rennes, where the people had begged her
to come, and where they received her with bursts of
enthusiastic loyalty and abuse of the traitors of
Nantes.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>Her cousin, Jean de Châlons, who was taken
prisoner with the Duc d’Orléans, but had been
released,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> was Anne’s great friend and supporter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
against Albret; and in March, 1490, it was decided
to place her under the protection of the Emperor, by
marrying her to his son, the King of the Romans.
Negotiations were accordingly carried on with profound
secrecy. Madame de Laval, seeing that her
efforts were vain, abandoned the cause of her brother;
Maximilian, King of the Romans, sent the Baron
Volfan de Polhaim, with several other nobles, to
Bretagne, and a few days after the ceremony of
betrothal was gone through, and the marriage
celebrated without any one knowing the day on
which it took place. According to the old German
custom in such cases, the young princess was
placed in her bed into which Polhaim, as proxy
for Maximilian, put his bare leg up to the knee
in presence of the three other envoys, Madame de
Laval and some members of the household of the
Duchess, and declared the marriage to be consummated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1490}</div>

<p>It was not likely that so important an event could
be long concealed. The Chancellor de Montauban
was one of the first to let it out by giving Anne, in
several official acts, the title of Queen of the Romans.
This disclosure caused an outburst of anger and
commotion. The French pushed on the war with
more activity than ever, Alain d’Albret betrayed
Nantes into their hands, and Charles VIII. refused
to acknowledge the legality of the marriage, contracted
without his consent.</p>

<p>Anne, who was in desperate straits for want of
money, sold her plate and jewels, and struck a
coinage of leather with a small piece of silver in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
centre. She gave the command of her army to Rieux,
who had left Albret, returned to his allegiance, and for
the sake of the country, been pardoned. He drove the
French out of Lower Bretagne; Brest, St. Malo, and
some other towns held out for her; she had English
archers and German and Spanish troops from
Maximilian, but was too weak to withstand the
French, who, late in the autumn, laid siege to
Rennes.</p>

<p>Anne made her Chancellor, Montauban, promise
not to leave her for a day; she trusted also in Jean
de Châlons and Dunois, who was as brave as his
renowned father though his enormous size interfered
with his activity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> French army lay encamped before Rennes.
Hostilities began by the Bastard de Foix
dressed as St. George, riding up to the walls and
challenging any knight to come out and break a
lance with him in honour of the ladies. A Breton
noble in complete armour at once appeared, lists
were made among the moats, Anne had a scaffolding
erected from which she with her ladies and court
witnessed the combat, first with lances, then with
swords, and, after she had supplied hypocras and
other refreshments to the French, every one retired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1491}</div>

<p>Next day the siege began. Provisions and money
ran short and the Princess Isabelle died. Charles
offered Anne a large pension, any place she chose
to live in except Rennes or Nantes; and Louis de
Luxembourg, the Comte d’Angoulême or the Duc de
Nemours for a husband in exchange for the duchy,
which she refused. He next offered her foreign
troops all the arrears due to them if they would
withdraw from Rennes, which they immediately did.
Then he tried to induce her to accept a large allowance,
give up the duchy and go to the King of the
Romans; and finally proposed that she should throw
over Maximilian, who could get no money from his
father, the Emperor, had never even seen her, and
probably cared very little for the marriage (having
lately lost Marie de Bourgogne whom he loved
passionately), and marry him.</p>

<p>It was far the best way out of this disastrous state
of things. Charles was politically her enemy, but
she had no personal dislike to him, he was a suitable
age and a splendid match, besides which it was
evident that she must either accept him or lose
Bretagne altogether. And whether it would be
better for her or Bretagne that she should be a
landless fugitive or Queen of France was a question
about which there was no doubt whatever in the
minds of any of the sensible people who surrounded
her. Her cousin, the Prince of Orange, her guardian,
the Maréchal de Rieux, her Chancellor, Montauban,
and her governess, Madame de Laval, all told her
the same thing, and tried to persuade her to consent
to this marriage. The Duc d’Orléans, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
released by the intercession of his wife; and the
Comte de Dunois, added their entreaties, and Anne
at last began to hesitate. Then Madame de Laval
told her confessor and begged him to speak to her.
He accordingly assured her that it was required of
her by God and the Church to make this sacrifice
for the good of her country and the restoration of
peace. Anne yielded to the only authority she
recognised and consented to an interview with the
King.</p>

<p>Charles therefore went, on pretence of a pilgrimage
to the chapel of Notre Dame which was at the gate
of Rennes. After his devotions were finished, he
suddenly entered the town accompanied by the
Princess Anne de Beaujeu, and an armed escort.
The next day he presented himself at the palace
of the Duchess. They had a long private audience
in which Charles seems to have succeeded in overcoming
any dislike Anne may have had for him, as
they were betrothed to each other three days afterwards
in the chapel of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>Two solemn contracts had to be broken for the
sake of this marriage, so important both to Bretagne
and France. Besides the ceremonial marriage of
Anne and Maximilian, his daughter Marguérite had
not only been for the last eight years the legal wife of
Charles VIII., but had been brought up in France
and treated as Dauphine and then as Queen. The
marriage, which was of course only a form, had been
celebrated at Amboise just before the death of
Louis XI., with pomp and ceremony in the
presence of the court, the Dauphin being then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
twelve and the Princess Marguérite three years
old.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p>It was a great affront to Maximilian, both on his
own account and that of his daughter, who, though
so young, was extremely indignant, having long considered
herself Queen of France. She was conducted
back to her father with great state, and when, as
she passed through Arras, the people began the
French cry of “Noël, Noël!” she said impatiently,
“Do not cry ‘Noël!’ but ‘Vive Bourgogne!’” She
was afterwards the famous Regent of the Netherlands,
and throughout her life never forgot the slight or felt
anything but enmity to France, in which, however,
she did not include the Queen, who had sent her
splendid jewels and beautiful embroideries, and with
whom she was always on friendly terms.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>A chronicler favouring the Austrian party, observes
in his writings that with respect to this alliance three
things are most surprising: first, that Charles VIII.
should have had the audacity to carry it out, being
already married to the daughter of Maximilian;
secondly, that the Duchesse de Bretagne should have
accepted the deadly enemy of her house as her
husband; and thirdly, that the Seigneur de Dunois,
who had done so much to bring about this marriage,
should have fallen dead from his horse as he returned
from the betrothal, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ce qui épouvanta fort tout le
peuple</i>.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
For Dunois, one of the most faithful friends of the
young Duchess, never saw her crowned Queen, having
been seized with apoplexy as just described.</p>

<p>Although by this alliance Anne gained a much
higher rank, she lost that of a sovereign princess.
Charles was the conqueror, and she had no choice
but to submit to the French terms, which were&mdash;that
the duchy of Bretagne should pass entirely into
the hands of the King; that if she should survive
him but have no living children, it should again
become hers, but that in that case, in order to avoid
another war she should bind herself not to marry any
one but the King of France or his heir; that she
should receive the same dowry as the King’s mother;
and, by his special desire, that any jewels, furniture,
or property of whatever value, which might be in her
possession at the King’s death, should be hers absolutely.
The Prince of Orange approved of this
contract, which she signed on her wedding day,
December 6, 1491.</p>

<p>In spite of her poverty, Anne displayed royal
magnificence in her dress and all the accessories of
her wedding. It is probable that the States granted
her a large sum of money for that occasion. At any
rate her wedding-dress of cloth-of-gold with gold
embroideries, cost 126,000 francs (present value), and
all her travelling appointments were splendid. She
gave velvet dresses to the ladies and gentlemen of
her household, that of Madame de Laval being of
violet velvet, and a costume of cloth-of-gold to the
Prince of Orange.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Anne was now fifteen years old and the King
twenty. After their wedding, they went to Tours,
and then to Paris, splendidly received all the way.
Anne was crowned at St. Denis in the following
February, on which occasion she was dressed in
white satin. The crown was too large and heavy
for the young head, and was held by Louis, Duc
d’Orléans. The next day she entered Paris.</p>

<p>De Mézeray declares that Anne had an immense
influence over the King, and that she ruled her own
duchy entirely. But M. Le Roux de Lincy denies
this statement, and quotes in support of such contradiction
two well-known historians of Bretagne,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> who
assert that during the whole of the married life of
Charles VIII. and Anne, all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">actes de Bretagne</i> are
in the name of Charles alone, without that of Anne
ever being mentioned.</p>

<p>In spite of the King’s jealous monopoly of her
duchy, he was always much attached to the Queen,
although this did not prevent his carrying on many
love affairs and intrigues with other women, greatly
to her displeasure; and every now and then arose
quarrels and disputes about this or that person to
whom his attentions were too much directed. But
they were always together, except when he was at
war; he lavished money and every luxury upon her,
and was as much influenced by her as he could be
by anybody. For Charles was obstinate, rash, and
chimerical; and in many matters would take no
advice from any one. He was not handsome like
most of his family, being short and badly made; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
he had beautiful eyes, a charming expression and
manners so gentle and courteous that it was said that
no one had ever heard him say a rude or harsh thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1492}</div>

<p>Madame de Beaujeu, sister of the King, who had
been hitherto the greatest lady in France, began by
trying in vain to oppose and interfere with the Queen,
who, having from childhood been accustomed to the
deference and obedience due to a sovereign princess,
declined to allow her authority to be questioned, so
that the late Regent had to yield.</p>

<p>Charles and Anne lived chiefly at Plessis and
Amboise, which he had caused to be magnificently
refurnished and decorated for her reception.</p>

<p>Whenever it was possible Anne travelled by water,
the rivers being still the chief highways, and the
great barges with wooden houses on board the most
comfortable conveyances. On October 10th was
born the Dauphin, Charles-Orland, at Plessis, to the
great rejoicing of France, Bretagne, and the King;
he was christened with splendid ceremonial, his god-parents
being the Queen-dowager of Sicily and the
Dukes of Orléans and Bourbon. He was dedicated to
the Virgin, and always dressed in white and cloth of
silver. A few months afterwards the King and Queen
set off for Lyon, leaving him at Amboise, surrounded
by the strictest precautions, amongst which was one
forbidding any one to visit him who had ever been in
Italy.</p>

<p>They stayed at Lyon and Grenoble amidst much
festivity until the baggage arrived, was unloaded
from the chariots and packed on mules to cross the
Alps. On September 1st, after attending mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Charles bade the Queen farewell, mounted his horse,
placed himself at the head of his army and started,
accompanied by Louis d’Orléans.</p>

  <img src="images/i_341.jpg" width="332" height="397" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">TOUR D’AMBOISE.</div></div>

<p>Anne remained at Lyon, and at first the King’s
daily letters brought news of unbroken conquests,
which, however, like all the French victories in Italy,
melted away, leaving nothing but disaster to France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
It was fifteen months before Charles returned to
Lyon where Anne had waited for him. In spite of
his reverses he was in good spirits and resolved on
another Italian campaign, for like all the Valois he
was an ardent soldier. His favourite charger “Savoie,”
a splendid black horse with only one eye, had carried
him through all the battles and loved him so much
that he would fight for him with his teeth and hoofs.
He was given him by the Duc de Savoie.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Amongst
other adventures is told the story of a young girl to
whom he took a fancy at Naples. She was brought
to his palace there and when left alone with him she
explained that she had not come of her own free will,
but had been carried off by force, and threw herself
on his mercy. Charles assured her that she need fear
no violence from him, sent her away in safety, and
promised her his protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1495}</div>

<p>In December, 1495, the Dauphin, then about three
years old, was suddenly taken ill and died at Amboise,
where he had always lived. Although he had been
so little with his parents they were most anxious
about him, and constant news of him had always
been sent them. M. Le Roux de Lincy gives several
letters written by the Queen to his governor, full of
inquiries and directions respecting him. He was a
beautiful, precocious child,<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> and his death was a
severe blow to his parents. Philippe de Commines,
who had a grudge against Charles because he had
been imprisoned by him and the Regent, says that
he cared very little, being jealous of the Dauphin, a
most absurd supposition regarding a child of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
years old, and it being most unlikely that he should
have<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> preferred his heir to be Louis d’Orléans instead
of a son of his own. On the contrary, the shock made
both Charles and Anne so ill and depressed that the
doctors ordered the King to be amused, therefore
many more gaieties took place at court than the
Queen felt inclined for. She hated being present
at them, and quarrelled with the Duc d’Orléans
because he seemed to her in such good spirits that
she fancied he was glad to be again heir-presumptive
and to be called “Monseigneur,” which she could
not bear to hear.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> This caused a coolness between
Louis and the King and Queen, so that he retired to
Blois, where he surrounded himself with literary men
and collected a large library, including the books and
manuscripts written by his father. Anne had another
son next year, also named Charles, the following year
one called François, and then a daughter named
Anne. But although she got strong Bretonne women
to nurse them and took every precaution she could
not save any. None of them lived more than a few
weeks. They were buried in an exquisitely sculptured
tomb of white marble in the cathedral of Tours.</p>

<p>The King and Queen, finding no medicine or cure
any use, had tried various superstitious means. They
had a whole coffer full of charms and amulets, and
the people said it was a curse on them because they
had not been free to marry each other. But they were
still very young and hoped yet to have living children.
Charles began to think that these misfortunes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the punishment of Heaven for his dissipated life, and
resolved to reform. Anne was so uneasy and jealous
of his proceedings that she could not bear him to be
out of her sight, and had at one time brought on a
miscarriage by persisting in going out hunting when
she was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enceinte</i> because she did not want him to go
without her. Now, however, Charles declared he
would have no more love affairs, would give his
whole attention to his kingdom and people. He
had planned another Italian campaign and a crusade
against the unbelievers, but it was strongly represented
to him that he ought not to leave France
without having an heir. The Queen, who dreaded
another long separation, was naturally of the
same opinion, and Charles was persuaded to
remain in France, and began to alter and decorate
his favourite château of Amboise. He had brought
books, pictures, statues, and all sorts of treasures from
Italy, and had become much influenced by the
splendour of the renaissance then prevailing there.
He began the great tower with an inclined ascent by
which a troop of cavalry can ride to the top, from the
lower entrance down by the river.</p>

<p>The splendid old château had become more comfortable
and luxurious than ever under the rule of
Anne de Bretagne.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Tapestries hung on the walls,
thick carpets lay on the floors, curtains of damask
and satin were over the beds and everywhere. The
Queen was at Amboise with the King, who could not
bear to be separated from her, and in whose pursuits
and diversions she always shared. One day, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
two o’clock in the afternoon, he proposed that they
should go and look on at a game of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">paume</i> which
was to be played <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dans les fossés du château</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1497}</div>

<p>She consented, and the King, taking her by the
hand, they left her private apartment together.
They had to pass through a low, dirty, dilapidated
gallery which Charles intended to have pulled down,
and in entering which he struck his head violently
against its arched doorway.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> He declared, however,
that he was not much hurt and they proceeded to
the seats from which they were to watch the game.
While it was going on the King talked and laughed
as usual, but when it was over he complained of pain
in his head and said he would go to his own room.
The Queen, dreadfully frightened, went with him.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
As they walked back he began to speak of his
repentance for the faults and follies of his life, and
just as he said, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">J’espère bien ne commettre aucun péché,
soit mortel, soit véniel</i>,” he suddenly fell to the ground.
They were again at the entrance of the fatal gallery,
where a straw mattress being hastily thrown on the
floor he was laid upon it. They dared not move him,
so he lay there until about eleven at night, only
recovering consciousness for a few moments, when,
after murmuring, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu! Vierge Marie! Monseigneur
Saint Claude! Monseigneur Saint Blaise me
soient en aide!</i>” he died.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

The Queen, who was only two and twenty, had
now lost her mother, father, sister, children, and husband.
In a frenzy of grief and despair she shut
herself up in her own rooms where she remained
crying, wringing her hands and refusing to eat.</p>

<p>The Duc d’Orléans, now Louis XII., was still at
Blois, and much distressed at the melancholy state of
the Queen. He sent the Cardinal Briçonnet and the
Bishop of Condon, who had been friends of hers and
of Charles VIII., to see her.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> They found her lying
on the floor sobbing and crying in a corner of the
room. She did not get up when they came in, but
the Bishop, a man of holy life and intellectual power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
succeeded in comforting her so far that she listened
to his words of consolation, rose, became calmer, and
was persuaded to take some food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1498}</div>

<p>Then she began to think about her beloved
Bretagne, now her own again, and directly she had
finished that first repast she signed a decree reestablishing
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chancellerie</i> which had been suppressed.</p>

<p>Her nearest remaining relation was her brother the
Baron d’Avaugour, but she was very fond of her
cousin, Jeanne de Laval, Queen-dowager of Sicily,
to whom she wrote, telling her of the death of the
King; and also of the Prince of Orange, Jean de
Châlons, for whom she sent at once and whom she
made governor of Bretagne.</p>

<p>Three days after the death of Charles, Louis XII.
came to see her. He promised to give a splendid
funeral to the late King, which he did. Anne
ordered her mourning to be black instead of the
white usually worn by Queens of France, and sent
to the prelates, nobles, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i> of Bretagne to
come and escort her to Paris, where, according to
custom, she was to pass the first months of widowhood;
the hôtel d’Estampes, one of the group forming
the hôtel St. Paul, having been prepared for her.</p>

<p>On May 15th she left Amboise with her great Breton
train, paid a state visit to the King, and establishing
herself in her hôtel turned her attention to the government
of Bretagne, demanding from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mâitre de la
Monnaie</i> at Nantes the gold and silver coinage with
the effigies of her father and herself, appointing her
brother and other Breton nobles governors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
towns, from which the French troops were now withdrawn,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a>
writing constantly to her relations, friends,
and officers, and occasionally seeing Louis XII., who
did everything he could to please her.</p>

<p>For although he could not have been in love with
her, as some historians assert, before she was ten
years old, it is certain that he was
now most anxious to marry her,
not only as Duchesse de Bretagne
but as the woman he admired and
loved.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> He was thirty-four, handsome,
and extremely attractive, and
Anne, besides being ambitious and
reluctant to lose the French crown,
seems to have returned his affection.
A French writer remarks
that her love for Charles had arisen
from duty, and therefore was not
likely to be very lasting,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> which
may well have been the case. But
it was evident that no such marriage
could take place until Louis
had obtained a divorce from his
present wife, Jeanne de France, for
which purpose he began negotiations with the Pope,
the friendship between Anne and himself meanwhile
increasing as may be seen by the following <span class="locked">letter:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur mon bon frère</span>,&mdash;Je aye receu par

</p></blockquote>

<p>In June they met at Estampes and agreed to marry
each other as soon as Louis could get his divorce.
Anne went back to Paris, and later in the summer
she went to Laval to stay with the Queen-dowager of
Sicily, after which she returned to Bretagne, where
she was received with great state and universal joy.
Delighted to be once more in possession of her own
duchy she resolved now that she had recovered the
reins of government never again to let them slip
out of her hands. Under her supervision a history
of Bretagne was written by a learned priest, her
almoner, from the papers and records in different
monasteries.</p>

<p>She ruled Bretagne as a sovereign princess with
much wisdom and capacity, and being generous and
charitable she made various excellent laws for the
good of the people. Her own household she arranged
on a magnificent scale, and appointed a guard of a
hundred Breton gentlemen who escorted her wherever
she went.</p>

<p>While she was at Nantes her old governess, Madame
de Laval, died, to her great sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1499}</div>

<p>The question of the King’s divorce was heard
before an ecclesiastical tribunal, and the marriage
dissolved by Alexander VI. (Borgia).</p>

<p>Louis made Jeanne Duchesse de Berry and gave
her a splendid appanage of lands and money. She
retired to Bourges, founded the order of the Annonciades,
became Superior of it, and died in 1500, after
a life of charity and devotion. The dissolution of a
marriage to which he had always had an unconquerable
repugnance cannot be considered surprising, but
at first many of the people were indignant and pointed
at the judges, saying, “There is Caiaphas, there is
Herod, there is Pontius Pilate; they have judged
against <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la haute dame</i> that she is not Queen of
France.”<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>Alexander VI.,<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> of the noble Spanish family of
Borgia, had in his youth a natural daughter, the
famous Lucrezia, Duchess of Ferrara, and four sons.
The eldest and youngest he married to daughters of
the King of Naples, the second, Giovanni, Duca di
Gandia was supposed to have been murdered by his
next brother, the Cardinal Cesare, or Cæsar, who had
become a soldier and who surpassed most of his
contemporaries in the enormity of his crimes.
The Pope now sent him to France with a Cardinal’s hat
for George d’Amboise, the King’s favourite minister,
and the bull for the dissolution of his marriage,
Louis promising him the duchy of Valentinois, a
large pension and one of his relations in marriage.</p>

<p>The court was at Chinon when he arrived. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
followers, horses, and mules were covered with silk,
velvet, and cloth of gold. The horse he rode had
trappings of cloth of gold covered with precious
stones; he himself wore a dress of red satin and
cloth of gold bordered with pearls and gems; his
hat was trimmed with a double row of rubies as big
as beans, which shed a strange light; even his
boots were covered with gold cords and edged with
pearls. Around his neck was a necklace or collar
worth 30,000 ducats.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> He gave the cardinal’s hat
to the King, telling him that the bull was not ready,
although he had it with him, as he hoped to be
able to extort something more from Louis. The
Pope’s nuncio however told the King that the dispensation
had been made out long ago, and that
Cæsar had got it. He was therefore obliged to deliver
it up, but he invited the nuncio to dinner, and, as he
was foolish enough to accept, he died of poison
shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The wife upon whom Borgia fixed his choice was
Charlotte d’Aragon, daughter of Frederic III., King of
Naples and Sicily, called Princesse de Tarente at the
French Court, where her mother, the niece of Queen
Charlotte de Savoie, had been brought up. When
she died, as Frederic, engaged in perpetual strife,
could not look after his daughter, she had been
adopted by Charles VIII. when about ten years old,
and lived at court ever since.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> She had a complete
household, a litter, mule, and several horses, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
treated as a royal princess,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> and was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demoiselle
d’honneur</i> to the Queen. She grew up into a most
attractive girl&mdash;pretty, clever, amusing, kind-hearted;
the favourite of the whole court. The Queen, who
was extremely fond of her, when, after the death of
Charles VIII., she returned to Bretagne, gave her a
silver toilette service and parted from her reluctantly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1500}</div>

<p>When Charlotte heard that Cæsar Borgia wanted
to marry her she was very much alarmed, very much
horrified, and very angry. She declared that she
would not marry that abominable man, and entreated
her father and every one she knew to protect her.
Borgia, who had set his mind on her, and also hoped
to get hold of the principality of Tarentum, pressed
for an answer. Charlotte positively refused, declaring
that she would not have for her husband a priest, the
son of a priest, and a fratricide, whose birth and conduct
were alike, infamous. Cæsar revenged himself
by getting up a league against Frederic, who fled to
Ischia and thence to France. The Queen was
delighted with her courage, and in 1500 married her
to Guy de Laval, a handsome young Breton noble,
very rich and a cousin of her own, so that Charlotte
not only became still more nearly connected with the
Queen, but remained at court.</p>

<p>Anne chose to be married at Nantes in January,
and this time the contract secured her entire control
of the government and revenues of Bretagne, with
power to leave it to her own heirs after the death of
the King if they had no children. Besides her dowry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
from Charles she had one of equal amount for her life
from Louis.</p>

<p>The King and Queen spent most of the winter in
Bretagne, hunting and amusing themselves, and in
April travelled slowly to Blois, great festivities
attending their progress.</p>

<p>The Queen’s second marriage was much happier
than the first. In appearance, intellect, and character
Louis was far superior to Charles. The
intrigues and dissipations of his former life
disappeared before the higher, nobler love of which
Charles was incapable. No suspicion of unfaithfulness
ever arose between Anne and Louis;<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> she had
regained her beloved duchy, the management of
which was her chief interest and occupation, besides
the share she took in the government of France.
Though she had no better luck with the sons of her
second than of her first marriage her two daughters
lived, and upon them she lavished the passionate
affection she had given to the first Dauphin. Louis
was the idol of France; since the days of St. Louis
there had been no such king. To the virtues of
Charles V. he united the gallant grace and charm of
the Valois, and the people called him “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le père du
peuple</i>.”</p>

<p>Inheriting also the warlike spirit of his house, he
resolved to make an expedition to conquer the duchy
of Milan, now seized by Ludovico Sforza, but which
he claimed as heir of his grandmother, Valentine
Visconti.</p>

<p>The Queen, in her anxiety about the child she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
expecting, instead of accompanying him to the
frontier waited at Romorantin as the plague was at
Blois. Even there some of her household had it, and
when it abated she proceeded to Blois where her
daughter was born and named after Ste. Claude, to
whose shrine she had just made a pilgrimage.</p>

  <img src="images/i_357.jpg" width="176" height="350" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">LADY OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding his desire to have a son, Louis
received the news with great joy just as he was
entering Milan, and both he and the Queen were
always devoted to this child, which though small and
delicate lived to grow up. Not long afterwards Louis
returned with his victorious army, and the court
resumed its wonted gaiety, the Queen being anxious
that it should be the most magnificent in Europe.
She was very rich, exceedingly generous, and always
ready to pay any expenses that Louis, who was more
economical, thought too great. She held many
tournaments, at which she gave splendid prizes; she
was a great benefactress to the religious orders,
especially to the Cordeliers and Minimes, to whom
she gave convents,<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> and crowds of poor people
waited for alms at her gates.</p>

<p>The hôtel St. Paul, the favourite palace of Charles
V. and Charles VI., was now deserted. It was
considered unhealthy because of the malaria arising
from its many moats and ponds, and Louis XI. gave
away most of the splendid hôtels belonging to it.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>Louis XII. and Anne, when in Paris, lived at Les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Tournelles, a most picturesque and delightful old
château near St. Paul, but more healthy. It was
built in 1380, and had belonged to Jean Duc de
Berry, Charles VI., and Louis d’Orléans. It was
named from being a mass of little towers and turrets,
was very large and convenient, stood in a wood
like a country house, had chapels, galleries and
gardens with fountains and seats of turf. The Duke
of Bedford lived there during the English rule, and
his beautiful wife, Anne of Burgundy; they kept
flocks of peacocks and other rare birds.</p>

<p>Louis and Anne were as fond of animals as their
predecessors. The Queen kept a large hawking
establishment, and numbers of horses and mules;
her stables were magnificent, and her litters and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chariots branlants</i> (suspended) lined with soft
cushions and costly stuffs. She had many dogs of
different breeds and sizes.</p>

<p>The position of the Queen’s ladies was very distinguished
and important. Already in 1492 she had
sixteen <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dames</i> and eighteen <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demoiselles</i>, of the noblest
families. She was very strict, keeping constant
supervision over their books, songs, and amusements,
and forbidding them to be alone with the gentlemen
of the court, or talk to them about love that had
nothing to do with marriage. If they disobeyed her
she was implacable, otherwise she treated them with
unbounded kindness, gave them the same luxuries
she had herself, and took the greatest care of them in
illness. An existing account mentions silver plate
and a fur-lined coverlet for the night, ordered for
Anne de Foix when she was ill. She gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
dowries, arranged their marriages, and if their
husbands lived far away sent somebody to take care
of them and bring her news of them. Some she
loved almost like her own children.</p>

<p>Ladislas, King of Hungary, Poland, and Bohemia,
being a widower, wanted a French princess for his
wife. The Queen selected Anne de Candale and
Germaine de Foix, both pretty
girls and princesses of Foix, and
sent him their portraits. He
chose Anne, who did not wish to
be Queen of Hungary, but to
marry the Comte de Dunois, son
of the Queen’s old friend whom
he did not resemble, for though
handsome and agreeable he was
supposed to be wanting in
courage. The Queen would not
hear of it, and notwithstanding
the tears and objections of the
young princess the marriage was
celebrated by proxy, and she
started with a brilliant retinue in
charge of Bretagne, King-at-arms, whose account of
the grandeur of her reception, presents, &amp;c., still exists
in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bibliothèque Impériale</i>. Ladislas was enchanted
with her and wrote with enthusiastic gratitude to the
Queen, who was very fond of and anxious about her,
and many messengers and letters passed between
them; but the princess, who never became reconciled
to her splendid exile, died in giving birth to a
son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1501}</div>

<p>Germaine de Foix became the second wife of
Ferdinand, King of Spain.</p>

<p>The Queen apparently acted in an arbitrary manner
towards Anne de Rohan, who clandestinely married
a natural son of the house of Bourbon, and who, after
a stormy scene with her royal mistress, left the court
and was imprisoned by her father at a château in a
forest until, hearing that her husband had married
somebody else in Germany, she became the wife of
her cousin, Pierre de Rohan.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>Cæsar Borgia had insisted on a wife being found
for him, and the person so sacrificed was Charlotte,
the youngest daughter of Alain d’Albret. His consent
was bought by an enormous dowry from the
Pope and a cardinal’s hat for one of his family. Five
years later Cæsar Borgia was killed in a skirmish, and
the Duchess de Valentinois, his widow, who was
universally respected, retired in peace with her
daughter to a castle in Berry.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>In April came disastrous news from Milan, which
had revolted against the French, who now only held the
fortress itself.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> The King sent Louis de la Trémoille
and the Cardinal d’Amboise immediately to take
command, and the wise counsels of the one and the
military capacity of the other so rapidly turned the
tide that France was again victorious, Sforza was
taken prisoner, “and thus,” says the chronicler, “was
the duchy of Milan twice conquered in seven months
and a half, and for this time the war in Lombardy
finished.”<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

Her guard of gentlemen assembled always on the

right to receive separately all foreign ambassadors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
She delighted in flowers and gardening, her
favourite gardens being those of Amboise, given her
by Charles VIII., and of Blois by Louis XII. She
was also extremely fond of books, and had a splendid
library, for, besides all she inherited from her father
and the French kings, Charles VIII. brought her
eleven hundred and forty from Naples and Louis
XII. a thousand manuscripts from the library of the
Visconti at Milan. She employed a colony of
painters, sculptors, scribes, and architects brought
from Italy and established at Tours by Charles
VIII., and consequently possessed numbers of artistic
treasures, including that wonderful illuminated book
containing the psalms, prayers, and offices of the
Church richly adorned with flowers, animals, landscapes,
portraits and scenes in miniature well known
as the “Livre d’Heures d’Anne de Bretagne,” and
one of the most perfect examples of French art of
that day.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>She had a little room with boxes and drawers full
of costly jewels to give as presents. For dress personally
she cared little, although especially on state
occasions she was always magnificent in her toilette.
The fashions in her reign were exceedingly graceful
and artistic. Fine linen, velvet or satin shoes, long
trailing dresses open in front, made of cloth of gold
and crimson silk or velvet, with a golden girdle and
chaplet of pearls, chains and jewels round the neck,
headdress of white silk embroidered with gold and
pearls, hoods of cloth, satin, or velvet, scarlet for
bourgeoises, black for nobles. Sometimes long dresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
of black velvet. These were purely French till late
in this reign when Italian and Flemish costumes
began to be copied.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Charles VIII., being short and
ill-made, re-introduced the long robes of former
times, but Louis XII., who was tall and graceful,
usually wore short clothes. The Queen created an
order for the ladies of the court, called the Cordelière,
from the cords that bound Christ: the badge was a
jewelled necklace in the form of a cord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1502}</div>

<p>Before the Princess Claude was two years old
proposals came from the Emperor Maximilian to
marry her to his grandson, the Duke of Luxemburg,
son of the Archduke Philip of Austria. In
France the general desire was that she should
become the wife of the Comte d’Angoulême, heir-presumptive
to the throne of that country, but the
Queen strongly favoured the Austrian alliance. In
November, 1501, the Archduke and Archduchess
arrived on a visit. They were mounted on mules
covered with trappings of crimson velvet, next rode
a long train of ladies, and six hundred horses carried
litters and drew waggons after them. The procession
entered Blois at night; as it wound up
the steep street torches blazed on every house, and
the grand staircase of the castle was lined with
hundreds of archers of the guard in gilded armour.
The King, sitting in a great carved chair by the
fire, welcomed them, and asked the Archduchess if
it was her pleasure to bestow a kiss upon him,
which she did, after asking permission of the
Bishop of Cordova. Louis then saying that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
knew the ladies would like to be alone together, she
was taken to the Queen’s rooms, where Anne sat
by the fire surrounded by her ladies, who, it may here
be remarked generally sat on the floor or on cushions,
not many chairs being usual in the rooms. Later,
she retired to her bedchamber, where, escorted by six
pages in red and yellow with wax candles in gold
candlesticks, quantities of all kinds of sweetmeats
were carried to her by ladies and gentlemen, with
gold and silver boxes of knives, forks, serviettes, &amp;c.,
which were all placed on buffets and on the bed.
The Queen’s apothecary followed, and afterwards
came silver warming-pans and washing basins, velvet
coffers of brushes, combs, sponges, mirrors, and fine
linen.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1503}</div>

<p>The Princess Claude had been brought down, but
directly she saw her proposed mother-in-law she cried
so loud that she had to be removed by her governess.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>The Archduke had supper downstairs, but the King
did not join him as he was keeping the fast of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Notre
Dame des Avents</i> on bread and water. They stayed
five days, and the betrothal of the Princess was
concluded.</p>

<p>January 21, 1503, was born a Dauphin, who, however,
died immediately, to the general grief and
disappointment.</p>

<p>Next came news of reverses in Italy and the loss of
two battles, soon after which the King became very
ill. The Queen nursed him untiringly, scarcely ever
leaving his room; every one was in consternation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
the doctors gave up all hope of his recovery. Anne
was in despair. Added to her grief for him was the
dread of what would be the position of herself and
her daughter in the event of his death and the
triumph of Louise de Savoie and the hostile party,
at the head of which was Pierre de Rohan, Maréchal
de Gié, a Breton who had taken the side of
France against Bretagne.</p>

<p>She therefore ordered the officers of her household
to load two or three great barges on the Loire with
all her treasure and take them down to Nantes.
Then, if the King died, she could retreat with her
child to Bretagne, where they would be safe among
their own subjects.</p>

<p>But Gié, thinking the King’s death at hand, had
the insolence to stop the Queen’s barges, placing
10,000 archers to watch the Loire and prevent the
Princess Claude being carried out of France.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> This
attempt of one of her own subjects to take from
her guardianship her daughter, the heiress of Bretagne,
not of France, and to seize the property settled
on her by two kings, was not likely to be forgiven
by the Queen. Gié had overreached himself, for
Louis suddenly recovered, and on hearing of his
conduct, ordered his arrest. The judges who tried
him hated him, and condemned him to death, but
this sentence was quashed by the King, and Gié
was heavily fined, deprived of his post, and banished
from court for five years. Some French historians,
who seem to think any means justifiable to gain a
province for France, approve his conduct, and call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Anne vindictive for insisting on its punishment;
others will probably consider that he got what he
deserved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1505}</div>

<p>Gié retired to his magnificent château of Verger,
and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clercs de la Basoche</i> gave a play called
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Trop chauffer cuit, trop parler nuit</i>” alluding to
him. In another they said, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Un Maréchal avait
voulu ferrer une Anne (âne), mais elle lui avait donné
un si grand coup de pied qu’elle l’avait jeté hors de
la cour, pardessus les murailles jusque dedans le
verger.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>They were very witty, often impertinent. When
the King was told that they had ventured to represent
him, because of some necessary retrenchment, as
Avarice, he said that the people might laugh, and he
would rather be called avaricious than extravagant;
but when they attempted any ridicule of the Queen
he sternly forbade it, saying he would suffer no
disrespect to his wife, nor for that matter to any
woman in his kingdom.</p>

<p>The Queen’s second coronation at St. Denis and
entry into Paris took place when the King was
convalescent&mdash;with the same splendour as the first.
It was by torchlight, and after the usual fêtes and
banquet at the Palais they returned to Touraine,
and spent the rest of the summer at Blois, Loches,
and Amboise with the Princess Claude.</p>

<p>The year 1505 opened with an unsatisfactory state
of affairs in Italy,<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> where many of the best French
officers, amongst them the Chevalier Bayard, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
still engaged. The King became depressed and out
of spirits, all the more because of the dispute about
his daughter, whose marriage the Emperor kept
urging him to celebrate immediately with the Duke
of Luxemburg, while the French were so vehemently
in favour of François, whom he had created Duc de
Valois, that he felt both he and the Queen were
for the first time becoming unpopular. These
matters so preyed upon his mind as to bring on
an illness more serious than the last. He was
seized with fever and delirium, and all the country
was plunged into grief and alarm. Again the Queen
nursed him night and day, the people thronged
the churches,<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> masses were chanted, long lines
of cowled figures carried holy relics, with banners,
crosses, and swinging censers through the streets,
peasants left their work and multitudes with bare
feet, tears and lamentations flocked after the processions.
The Queen vowed that if he recovered
she would make a pilgrimage to Notre Dame du
Foll-Coat in Bretagne before the year was out.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>A romantic incident caused by this calamity was
the death of Tommasina Spinola, a beautiful Genoese
who had fallen in love with Louis in Italy. It was
a platonic, chivalrous romance, to which neither her
husband nor the Queen objected, and after the shock
of hearing that Louis was dead had been fatal to
her, he, having by this time recovered, desired Jean
d’Auton to write a record of her, which was presented
to him and the Queen at Tours.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1506}</div>

<p>In the summer the Queen set off for Bretagne
to fulfil her vow about the pilgrimage, leaving the
King at Blois with their child.</p>

<p>When once Anne was in Bretagne it was no easy
matter to get her away again, although Louis was
now left with Louise de Savoie, and all those who
were anxious for the French instead of the Austrian
marriage of the Princess Claude.</p>

<p>She took her ladies and a large suite of French
nobles, and was joined by numbers of Bretons, her
progress through her own dominions being one continual
triumph. She visited many of the towns,
which were richly decorated, and gave splendid
joustes and other fêtes in her honour, and having
made her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">neuvaine</i> and offerings at Foll-Coat, she
summoned the States, transacted a great deal of
business, and went to Brest to see her favourite
ship, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Marie-la-Cordelière</i>.</p>

<p>The King, however, got very tired of being without
her, and sent her a message to come and join him at
Angers. She was then at Morlaix suffering from
inflammation in the eye, and sent for a relic
supposed to be the finger of St. John Baptist, to
cure her. It was kept in a church at Plougarnon,
not far off, but she was presently told that it had
disappeared on the way, and been found in the
church again. Then Anne with all her suite went to
Plougarnon, slept in the village, and attended mass
at the dawn of day in the ancient church with
massive square tower and quaint leaden steeple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
standing in a green valley by a brook flowing
down to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> The Bishop of Nantes touched
the Queen’s eye with the relic when she had received
the Communion; she made her offerings, and the
pilgrimage was finished.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>The King kept writing to her to come back, and
began to get very angry at her delay. The Cardinal
d’Amboise, who was very much in the confidence of
them both, wrote three sensible and urgent letters,<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>
assuring her that he had never seen the King so displeased,
and begging her to return; saying what
a pity it would be if any dissension should arise
between them; also that the King was going back
to Blois and thence by water to Amboise, taking
Princess Claude and the Countess d’Angoulême with
him. The Queen therefore brought her Breton tour
to an end, and returned to Blois in September.</p>

<p>Her arrival dispelled the King’s vexation, but to
her dismay she found him bent upon breaking off
the Austrian engagement of their daughter, for many
were murmuring against the Queen for allowing her
dislike of Louise de Savoie to influence her to the
detriment of France. Even the Bretons preferred
the future King of France to the grandson of the
Emperor, and although the prediction of Anne that
François would not care about Claude, who was
neither pretty, clever, nor attractive, was certainly
verified, there seems no reason to suppose she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
would have been happier with the Duke of Luxemburg,
afterwards Charles V. Louis said he was
resolved “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de n’allier ses souris qu’aux rats de son
grenier</i>;” and when Anne impatiently remarked,
“To hear you one would think mothers conspired
to injure their daughters,” he asked if she thought
it was the same thing to rule Bretagne as to wear
the crown of France, saying, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voulez-vous préferer le
bât d’un ane</i> (Anne) <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la selle d’un cheval?</i>” and
as she still seemed unconvinced, he told her that
at the Creation God gave horns to hinds as well
as stags, but finding they wanted to govern everybody,
He took them away as a punishment.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>But not wishing to act in defiance of the Queen,
Louis agreed that at the meeting of the States at
Tours, in May, 1506, the deputies should implore
him on their knees to consent to the marriage of
the Princess Claude to François, Duc de Valois.
As he had foreseen, the Queen could not then
oppose it; and on Ascension Day the children
were betrothed in the great hall of the Castle of
Plessis les Tours, she being six and he twelve years
old.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1503}</div>

<p>Louis de Malet, Admiral de Graville, bore one of
the oldest names in France, and had been the favourite
of three kings. That he was a man of great
capacity and wisdom is proved by his correspondence,
now existing in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bibliothèque Impériale</i>. He
was also extremely cultivated. He gave a bell to
Rouen Cathedral, built the portal of Sens and a
church near Paris. He collected a valuable library
of manuscripts, with illuminations, miniatures, poems
in French and Italian, &amp;c., and filled his château of
Marcoussy with pictures and splendid furniture.</p>

<p>Marcoussy, about eighteen miles from Paris, was
one of the most imposing castles in the Ile-de-France,
with its massive walls, huge towers, and
deep moats, surrounded by trees and gardens with
terraces, fountains, and fishponds. Here he passed
most of his time when not occupied in public
affairs, and here grew up his children, Louis,
Joachim, Jeanne, Louise, and Anne. They studied
music, poetry, literature, and received altogether as
good an education as was then attainable. The
youngest, Anne, was herself the authoress of a
poem written on one of the stories of Boccaccio,
and many an exquisite embroidery for church or
convent was done by the three sisters.</p>

<p>But upon the prosperous, happy lives of the Gravilles
sorrow began to fall. Louis and Joachim died,
and their loss so affected their mother that she also
died in March, 1503, desiring to be buried near
Joachim in the monastery of Marcoussy. Louise
and Jeanne had made brilliant marriages, and Anne
was left alone with her father, whose favourite she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
was, and who dreaded parting with her. However,
between marriage and the cloister there was no alternative,
and the Admiral wrote to her saying he had
received offers from three young nobles, of whom he
thought the first frivolous, the second rash and hasty,
but the third, though less rich, was sensible and irreproachable
in character.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p>But meanwhile, Anne fell in love with her cousin
Pierre, Baron d’Entragues, illegitimate son of Robert
de Balzac, a young soldier of four and twenty who,
fearing the Admiral might not allow the marriage,
carried her off; some said with, others without her
consent. At any rate she forgave him, and their
marriage was celebrated without waiting for the
permission of the Admiral, who was very angry,
threatened to disinherit his daughter and forbade
any one to help them. The Baron d’Entragues had
no money and when he applied for help to his
relations they refused; the young people had nothing
to live upon and did not know what to do. So they
bethought themselves of the good monks of the
Céléstin convent of Marcoussy and took refuge with
them. The Prior and brotherhood received them
with kindness, sympathy, and promises of help, and
they stayed in the monastery waiting till Good
Friday, which was now approaching, when the
Admiral was sure to come there to church.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when he presented himself at the
office of the veneration of the Cross, the Prior
stopped him, saying, “Dare you approach with your
lips the sacred wood on which the Son of God shed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
His precious blood to reconcile men with His Father;
if you have not resolved from your heart to forgive
your two children who are here at your knees with
profound repentance imploring pardon for their
fault?” As he spoke Pierre and Anne threw
themselves on their knees before him. The solemn
words of the Prior and the sight of the child who had
always been so dear to him were too much for the
Admiral, he held out his arms to them both, and
took them back with him to the castle.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> The
marriage proved a very happy one. Anne had a long
prosperous life, and one of her children inherited
Marcoussy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1507}</div>

<p>In the spring of 1507, Louis went to Genoa, to put
down a revolt there, which, having done, he recrossed
the Alps and came to Grenoble, where the Queen went
to meet him. While he was there the Princess Claude
was seized with a kind of continuous fever which
greatly alarmed and distressed the Queen, who kept
up a constant correspondence with Madame des
Bouchage, governess to the little princess, being
always fully informed of her condition. The doctors
at first declared she would not recover, but as she very
soon became much better, the Queen, who did not
believe in doctors because they had been altogether
wrong about her eldest son, and failed to save either
him or any of her other children, was so angry, and
so confirmed in her opinion that she wrote to
Madame des Bouchage that the child was not to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
any more of them, for they were no use, she must
take care of her herself.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> The Princess Claude soon
recovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">{1508}</div>

<p>The Italian war dragged on. The league of
Cambrai was formed against Venice in 1508, and
Louis was eager to be again at the head of the
French army. Anne did all she could to dissuade
him, and tried to induce him to return to Blois,
assuring him that Claude was fretting to see him,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>
but it was useless. He recrossed the Alps, and
soon came tidings of the victory of Agnadel and
conquest of nearly all the Venetian mainland provinces.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>He returned, safe and victorious, to Blois at the
end of the summer, and there during that year took
place the wedding of Marguérite, sister of François,
Duc de Valois, with the Duc d’Alençon. It was
celebrated with suitable splendour and followed by a
great banquet and ball, after which there were joustes.
The Duc de Valois kept the lists with eight others,
served by the King himself, the princes who
contended were so young that small lances were
made on purpose. The Pope’s legate not being well,
looked on from a window. Next day they fought
again, this time in white armour, the bridegroom
dressed in white satin. The Queen and her ladies
gave the prizes.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>They all delighted in festivities and amusements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fêtes champêtres</i> were often given in the open air,
a favourite day being Mid-Lent Sunday, called,
especially in the valleys of the Marne and Meuse,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dimanche des fontaines</i>. M. Siméon de Luce describes
those given in a preceding reign by Beatrix de
Bourlemont when young men and girls from the
neighbouring châteaux and peasants from the villages
hung garlands, dined, sang, and danced under an
ancient beech tree said to be haunted by fairies.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>A solemn and important domestic <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fête</i> in the country
was the first mass of a young priest. M. de Ribbe
describes one of their mediæval village festivals.
Presents were given, relations and friends assembled as
for a marriage or christening. They walked to church
two and two in a long procession, minstrels playing
before them and crowds following. A collection was
made in church and then there was a great banquet
in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bergerie</i> to which the relations contributed
various dishes, the cooking being done in a mill close
by.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p>On the opening of parliament it was customary to
present quantities of roses and violets to the members,
one special person being responsible. De Sauval
mentions an account owing to Marguérite le Mercier,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marchande de roses</i>, for four dozen <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chapeaux</i> of red
roses, eight bouquets of violets, and a great basinful
of flowers to cover the table, distributed to the
Presidents, Councillors, and other officers of the
King, the vigil of the feast of Whitsuntide, who were
assembled at the Chastelet for the deliverance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
prisoners in the said Chastelet “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comme d’anciennté a

<div class="sidenote">{1509}</div>

<p>Renée de France was born October, 1509. Amidst
the general disappointment at not getting a Dauphin,
the King and Queen rejoiced that this child lived.
She was afterwards the celebrated Duchess of
Ferrara.</p>

<p>The Queen from this time entertained the project
of leaving Bretagne to Renée, if she could not break
off Claude’s marriage, and constantly endeavoured to
gain the consent of the King; but, although, dreading
the outcry which would be the consequence, he would
not agree to her wishes, it seems very possible,
considering her great influence over him, that had
she lived longer she would have succeeded in
carrying out one or other of these plans. During her
lifetime she would never allow the marriage of
Claude to take place.</p>

<p>Anne was extremely fond of music; amongst other
musicians in her household were four Bretons
minstrels. About six months after the birth of
Renée, being at Chartres, she was so struck with the
voice of a chorister boy in the cathedral that she
asked the chapter to give him to her, and in return
for their doing so she said, “You have given me a
little voice and I will give you a large one,” and
accordingly presented them with a great bell, named
“Anne de Bretagne” to be rung every day from
Easter to Trinity, and 3,000 livres.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1510}</div>

<p>She rather prided herself upon her conversational
powers, indeed, writers of her day assert that nobody
could talk better, either in society or on State affairs.
The King, who liked to have her opinion about
everything that went on, always sent the ambassadors
to her after an audience with him.</p>

<p>One day she was going to receive the Spanish
ambassador, and not understanding Spanish she
asked her chamberlain, the Prince de Chalais, who
understood several languages, to teach her some
sentences to say to him. Chalais, who had a mania
for playing practical jokes, without considering
whether the Queen was a proper subject for one,
taught her some words not possible in any decent
society. Fortunately for himself he was so delighted
with his trick or so doubtful of the result of it that,
just before the audience, he told it to the King. He
laughed but hastened to warn the Queen, who was, of
course, exceedingly angry, would not receive Chalais
for some days, and would have dismissed him had not
the King dissuaded her, assuring her that he would never
have allowed her to say the words to the ambassador.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p>In 1510 Louis and Anne sustained an irreparable
loss by the death of the Cardinal d’Amboise.</p>

<p>As usual, the French successes in Italy had been
short lived. The Venetians under their famous
Doge, Loredan, had reconquered nearly all their
territory, and the members of the league of Cambrai
had turned against France, the Milanese was lost, and
the King of Spain seized the Spanish side of Navarre
including Pampeluna. Catherine de Foix, heiress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
the gallant Princes of Navarre and Queen in her
own right, remarked to her husband, Jean d’Albret,
“Dom Jean, if you had been born Catherine and I
Dom Jean, we should never have lost Navarre.”<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1511}</div>

<p>The Queen had so dangerous an illness in March,
1511, that her life was despaired of; but after
receiving the Communion she revived and by the
middle of April was tolerably well. In the following
January she had another son, who died like all his
brothers, and the doctors managed the Queen so
badly that her health was permanently injured. Late
in March the Austrian ambassador, who went to take
leave of her, found her still in bed but brave, cheerful,
and taking her usual interest in public affairs. She
did not get up until May, when she appeared much
better, but never really regained her strength, and
just then many circumstances combined to depress
and trouble her.</p>

<p>A great battle was fought August 10, 1512,
between the French and English fleets. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Regent</i>
with the English Admiral on board attacked the
famous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cordelière</i>, commanded by the Breton Hervé
Portzmoguet. The two ships were grappled together,
the battle raged fiercely and the dead lay in heaps on
the decks. Then Portzmoguet, seeing that all hope
was lost, set fire to both vessels, and, clad in complete
armour, threw himself from the mast into the sea.
The ships went down together with more than two
thousand men, the French fleet drew off to Brest,
the English to the high seas.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">{1514}</div>

<p>There was strife between the King and Pope, and
the Queen’s views were strongly opposed to those of
Louis. The Pope laid France under an interdict
from which he excepted Bretagne. In vain the King
assured her that women had no voice in Church
matters; she had but to point to Bretagne as her
answer, and to remind him that at fourteen years old
she had successfully opposed Innocent III. when he
illegally appointed two of his nephews to benefices in
her duchy. Also that her influence had prevented
Louis from occupying Rome, when, after the battle of
Ravenna, the road to the Eternal City lay open to his
victorious troops. She ultimately induced him to
subscribe to the Lateran Council, whereby the
Roman gained the victory over the Gallican party in
the Church.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>Anne was not yet thirty-eight, but her brilliant,
eventful life was drawing to a close. For a year or
two her health had been failing and on the 2nd of
January, 1514, she was taken ill at Blois and died
a week afterwards. Knowing that she would not
recover, one of her last orders was that her heart
should be sent to Nantes and laid in the tomb of her
father and mother in the land and among the people
she had so faithfully loved.</p>

<p>The King shut himself up alone for days wearing
the black mourning he had chosen, contrary to the
custom for Kings of France. From the shock of the
Queen’s death he never recovered. He only survived
for two months the preposterous marriage he was
induced to make in the following year with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
young sister of Henry VIII. for the purpose of
stopping the English war. Claude, wife of François I.,
died ten years after her mother leaving several
children, one of whom was Henri II., whose three
sons were the last kings of the house of Valois.</p>

<p>The funeral of the Queen at St. Denis was of
more than usual magnificence, and when her coffin
was lowered into the tomb there stepped forward
Champagne King-at-arms who, after calling three
times for silence, said, “King-at-arms of the Bretons,
do your duty.” Then Bretagne King-at-arms in his
coat of mail stepped forward and proclaimed, “The
most Christian Queen and Duchess, our sovereign
Lady and Mistress, is dead? The Queen is dead!
The Queen is dead!” The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chevalier d’honneur</i> with
the hand of justice, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Grand Maître de Bretagne</i>
(brother of the Queen) with the sceptre, and the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand écuyer</i> with the crown advanced, kissed them,
and gave them to the Bretagne King-at-arms, who
laid them on the coffin.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>In France, to which she had given a great province,
Anne de Bretagne was soon forgotten; but, in the
land she loved and ruled so well four hundred years
ago, her name and her memory are still honoured
and cherished by her own people.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Charles de Valois had three wives and fourteen children; two or
three of his daughters were named Isabelle. One married Robert
d’Artois. Sainte-Marthe says the marriage of Pierre and Isabelle took
place in 1322, in her early childhood; but other historians, with more
probability, place it in 1332.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> It is difficult to reconcile the conflicting dates given by historians.
There is no doubt that Jeanne was the eldest daughter, yet some place
her birth in 1337; and the second daughter Blanche, who in that case
would not have been born till 1338, is nevertheless declared to have
been sixteen years old when she became Queen of Spain, 1352, which
is manifestly impossible.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> There seems to be some doubt about Isabelle, as we hear nothing
about her in after life. One historian confuses her with her sister
Marguérite; another states that she married one Guillaume, Sire de
Mello; others that she died unmarried; most do not mention her at
all. If she ever existed she most probably died in childhood.</p></div>

the following account of it in modern France:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Most of these persons were still drunk, with the brandy they had
swallowed out of chalices&mdash;eating mackerel on the patenas! Mounted
on asses, which were housed with priests’ cloaks, they reined them
with priests’ stoles; they held clutched with the same hand communion-cup
and sacred wafer. They stopped at the doors of dram-shops;
held out ciboriums: and the landlord, stoup in hand, had to fill them
thrice. Next came mules high-laden with crosses, chandeliers, censers,
holy-water vessels, hyssops; recalling to mind the priests of Cybele,
whose panniers, filled with the instruments of their worship, served at
once as storehouse, sacristy, and temple. In such equipage did these
profaners advance towards the Convention. They enter there, in an
immense train, ranged in two rows; all masked like mummers in
fantastic sacerdotal vestments; bearing on hand-barrows their heaped
plunder&mdash;ciboriums, suns, candelabras, plates of gold and silver....
Not untouched with liquor, they crave to dance the Carmagnole also
on the spot: whereto an exhilarated Convention cannot but accede....
Several members, quitting their curule chairs, took the hand of
girls flaunting in priests’ vestures, and danced the Carmagnole along
with them. Such Old-Hallowtide have they in this year once named
of Grace, 1793” (“French Revolution,” Carlyle, vol. iii. p. 193).</p></div>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed. The
spelling of non-English words has not been thoroughly checked.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>The original book included a running timeline (years) at the top of
most pages. Those years appear here between paragraphs in the form:
{year} (where “year” is a number), with consecutive duplicates
omitted within each chapter. The dates in the timeline mostly are in
ascending sequence, but not always.</p>

<p>Index not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.
The “<i>See</i>”-type cross-links were added by the Transcriber, and
some of them may be incorrect.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottom of each page, have been collected
and placed at the end of this eBook, following the Index.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_2">2</a>: Small-caps names in the text version of the genealogy chart are shown in all-caps.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_45">45</a>: Closing quotation mark added after “no more children.”</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_195">195</a>: Closing quotation mark added after

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
